You are good at understanding sentiment information with judgements in the document.
Please predict the facet that the judgement sentence is talking about. You can refer to the context in the source document.

Facets:

Novelty:

How original the idea (e.g., tasks, datasets, or methods) is, and how clear where the problems
and methods sit with respect to existing literature (i.e., meaningful comparison).

Soundness:

There are usually two types of soundness:
(1) Empirical: how well experiments are designed and executed to support the claims,
whether methods used are appropriate, and how correctly the data and results are reported,
analysed, and interpreted.
(2) Theoretical: whether arguments or claims in the manuscript are well supported by
theoretical analysis, i.e., completeness and the methodology (e.g., mathematical approach)
and the analysis is correct.

Clarity:

The readability of the writing (e.g., structure and language), reproducibility of details, and
how accurately what the research question is, what was done and what was the conclusion
are presented.

Advancement:

Importance of the manuscript to discipline, significance of the contributions of the manuscript, and its potential impact to the field.

Compliance:

Whether the manuscript fits the venue, and all ethical and publication requirements are met.
Overall Overall quality of the manuscript, not for specific facets.
