In summary, the manuscript requires significant modifications across different facets before it could be considered for publication."

        "generation": "The manuscript offers a novel and intriguing approach by combining neural inverse rendering with traditional Monte Carlo ray tracing. The implementation of a denoising step is viewed favorably for its efficiency and resulting decrease in variance at lower sampling rates. The advancements offered by this study seem significant, particularly the improvements in learning scene properties decomposition. \n\nThorough evaluations of the method have been conducted, yielding convincing results. However, the consideration of only a single light bounce and the lack of quantitative evaluation of individual attribute reconstruction are points of concern. Additionally, the manuscript's discussion on system solutions needs to be elaborated upon for clarity. \n\nThe regularizer effect not being tested in the ablation study and evaluations focusing mainly on novel rendering/relighting without adequately addressing individual intrinsic components are seen to potentially negatively impact the soundness of the paper. \n\nNotwithstanding these concerns, the overall acceptance of the manuscript is highly convincing. It is thought to be better suited to CV or graphics venues than NeurIPS. Improvements on the discussed negatives could further refine the paper to clearly present its advances in this novel domain."
