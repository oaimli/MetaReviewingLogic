In terms of Novelty, the technical contribution of the paper is somewhat limited, and the application of SSE [Wu et al. 2019] to sequential recommendation is incremental. However, the execution of the paper looks solid. In terms of Soundness, some of the experiment results are not convincing, and some of the proposed approaches are not effective. However, the results of the experiments look comprehensive and work well in avoiding overfitting. In terms of Clarity, the authors change evaluation metrics in Table 3, which is unclear and hard to understand. On the other hand, the paper is well-presented, with clear and concise writing that is easy to follow. In terms of Compliance, the work does not meet the compliance criteria for ICLR, and the author has expressed a negative sentiment towards their own work. Overall, the manuscript shows promise but could benefit from further refinement and improvement.\n\nBased on these judgements, it is recommended that the manuscript be accepted for publication after addressing the identified weaknesses and improving the clarity of the evaluation metrics and the proposed approaches."

However, the idea of learning embeddings through concatenation of multiple layers of neural representation is original.\n\nRegarding soundness, the technical depth in the paper is limited, and the method is not efficient in both storage and computation. The proposed method is also more suitable for two or three structural classes, and it is more likely to create noisy embeddings. Some claims in the paper are not correct, and the proposed approach assumes that similar node embeddings should have similar structural roles, which is questionable.\n\nIn terms of advancement, the manuscript's contribution to the field of sentiment analysis is not ground-breaking, and it does not beat the state-of-the-art algorithms. The significance of the method is also questionable, as it is not clear how it improves upon previous work in the field.\n\nConcerning clarity, the authors have received mixed feedback, with some reviewers finding the paper to be well-written and easy to follow, while others noted confusion with confusing notations and logical problems. The example in (b) was also found to be incomplete, and further clarification was needed.
