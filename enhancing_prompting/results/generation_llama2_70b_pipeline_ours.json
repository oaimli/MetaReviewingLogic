The manuscript has the potential to advance the field of machine learning for combinatorial optimization. The author is optimistic about the paper's potential but also acknowledges that it needs improvement to realize its full impact.\n\nThe manuscript has both strengths and weaknesses in terms of clarity. The presentation of the results is systematic and transparent, and the writing is excellent. However, there are several areas where the manuscript can be improved in terms of clarity. The paper undersells itself and is tricky to linearly navigate for anyone but the most specialized readers. The font size in Table 1 is too small to read, making it difficult to navigate and draw meaningful conclusions from the table, even after zooming in. The write-up assumes a lot of familiarity with tree-search methods, making it uninviting even to researchers from the wider MLxCombOpt community. Additionally, the presentation of the results can be improved substantially, and the thousands of statistics in the main text need to be presented in a better way. Finally, it would be good if the reader could immediately identify the median MIS size without having to visually estimate it. Overall, the manuscript has some clarity issues that need to be addressed to make it more accessible to a wider audience.\n\nOverall, the manuscript has potential but requires further refinement to meet its full potential.

However, the rest of the paper is well-written and presents a useful paradigm.\n\nRegarding novelty, the manuscript's novelty is a mixed bag, with the core idea being well-defined and motivated, but the retrieve portion seeming similar to other retrieval methods. The different components proposed in the paper, such as CBR and KG, are not novel per se. However, the paper explores a novel direction and has good empirical results, making it a valuable addition to the literature.\n\nFinally, the judges find the manuscript to be slightly convincing to highly convincing in its advancement of the field, as it strengthens the work by adding CBR type approaches as a new type of strategy for boosting Deep RL and combining CBR with existing RL methods improves agent performance significantly.\n\nOverall, the reviewers generally found the paper to be interesting and mostly well-motivated, with some suggestions for improvement. The paper has the potential to make a valuable contribution to the field, particularly in the area of Deep RL."

It should also provide suggestions for improvement and, if necessary, a recommendation for the manuscript's fate.\n\n\nThe manuscript under consideration has received mixed reviews from five judges. While some judges have praised the study's empirical results, case studies, and comparison of results with other methods, others have raised concerns about the methodology, such as the order of the conditions, the use of the same example with different explanation methods, and the potential for participants to be biased towards certain explanations. Additionally, some judges have noted that the proposed technique is not well-suited for certain tasks, and that the experimental evaluations are lacking in certain aspects.\n\nIn terms of Advancement, the reviewers believe that the manuscript has potential but could benefit from further experimental investigation and revision to the theoretical approach. They suggest that additional experimental data and refinement of the theoretical framework would make the paper much better and more convincing.\n\nWith regard to Clarity, the reviewers have identified areas where the paper could be improved. They have suggested that the language used needs to be clearer, and that the authors should provide more context and explanations for their design choices. One judge also mentioned that the hyperparameter search procedure is hard to manually search over, and another found the readability and reproducibility of results to be lacking. However, one judge did mention that the problem and explanation methods are well motivated and introduced.\n\nRegarding Novelty, the judges have expressed mixed opinions. While some judges found the approach to be novel, others thought it was not clearly justified. One judge expressed concern about the generalizability of the proposed method. However, most judges agreed that the manuscript introduces a novel form of explanations for similarity-based models and studies an under-studied problem.\n\nOverall, the reviewers generally have a negative sentiment towards the manuscript, with some suggesting that it would be hard to argue for its usefulness in helping people understand the model. One reviewer would maintain a negative assessment of the manuscript, while a third reviewer borderline rejects the recommendation. The fourth reviewer tends to accept the present work, but does not believe that it meets the standard for publication. The last reviewer does not find the paper convincing at all.\n\nBased"

The reviewers have evaluated the manuscript based on four criteria: Novelty, Clarity, Soundness, and Overall.\n\nIn terms of Novelty, the reviewers generally agree that the manuscript presents a novel approach, idea, and neural net architecture. The 'D-Conv' operator is seen as a new concept, and the method is well-situated in the literature. The invariance to point cloud order and the relative simplicity of the architecture are considered strengths.\n\nRegarding Clarity, the reviewers have mixed opinions. Some parts of the paper, such as Figure 4, have lines that are hard to distinguish due to similar colors. However, the paper is interesting and has the potential to be clarified with some revisions. The author's use of notation and figure labels could be improved to enhance the clarity of the paper.\n\nThe reviewers have identified both strengths and weaknesses in terms of Soundness. Some of the claims made in the manuscript, such as the claim that smaller neighborhood sizes are just special cases of bigger neighborhood sizes, and the claim that the method is somewhat robust to outliers, are not entirely convincing. The experiments lack consideration of practical effects like day-of-week in forecasting, and there are no baselines. Additionally, the results tables may not be robust to outliers. However, some of the ideas in the manuscript are promising, and the manuscript presents several neighborhood sizes for experimentation.\n\nFinally, the reviewers have provided an overall assessment of the manuscript. While there are some areas that need improvement, the reviewer is slightly convinced by the rebuttal and is leaning more towards a positive sentiment.\n\nIn summary, the reviewers have identified both strengths and weaknesses in the manuscript. While the approach is novel and has the potential to be improved with revisions, the soundness of the manuscript needs to be addressed before it can be considered a strong piece of research. The reviewer is leaning towards a positive sentiment, but further revisions are necessary to fully address the concerns raised by the reviewers."

The sub-summaries cover the criteria of novelty, soundness, overall quality, and clarity.\n\nRegarding novelty, the judgments indicate that the manuscript lacks significant and original contributions. The idea of replacing SGD with Adam is seen as insufficient to justify the paper's novelty. However, the proof perspective is interesting but not enough to make the paper novel.\n\nIn terms of soundness, the reviewers have several concerns about the validity and convincingness of the manuscript's claims. The authors claim to show a trade-off for pruning Resnet-50 on the ILSVRC dataset, but the results are not presented. The ResNet-32 model is considered too complex for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The claim of Theorem 1 is counter-intuitive, and the experiments seem to be conducted based on a different joint objective. The bound provided by Theorem 1 is questioned, and the reviewer is unclear about how the trade-off in point (b) of the abstract is justified in the experiments.\n\nIn terms of overall quality, a reviewer has judged the manuscript as mostly like positive, with a positive sentiment expression. The paper is well-written, with clear and concise language, and the author has demonstrated a good understanding of the research question and literature. However, some of the author's conclusions are not well-supported by the data, and there are some minor errors in the paper.\n\nRegarding clarity, the manuscript could benefit from improved clarity in several areas. The author could provide more explanation of notation and avoid using ambiguous terms. Additionally, the author could improve readability by introducing concepts before presenting theorems. However, the author does provide clear explanations of the relation between FLOP and compression runtime.\n\nIn conclusion, the meta-review suggests that the manuscript needs more significant and original contributions to be considered novel. The validity and convincingness of the manuscript's claims need to be further investigated and clarified. The paper is well-written, but some areas for improvement include providing more explanation of notation, avoiding ambiguous terms, and introducing concepts before presenting theorems. Overall, the manuscript has both positive"

While there are some issues with clarity in terms of writing style and organization, the ideas are generally presented clearly, and the paper is well-motivated and well-written in some parts. The manuscript makes a valuable technical contribution to the field of AI and is a significant advancement. The study is important and relevant to the NeurIPS community, and the result of the work is significantly different, making it a strong positive contribution to the field. The novelty of the manuscript is highly convincing, as the authors study the exact parameter recovery in ReLU regression under a generalization of the semi-random Massart noise model, which is a novel and significant contribution to the field. However, there is a minor issue with the Introduction section, which hasn't been completely reflected in the grasp of existing literature. The judgements indicate that the manuscript's soundness has both strengths and weaknesses. While the algorithm can recover the exact parameters with high probability, there are some concerns about the suboptimal sample complexity for robust linear regression and the unpleasant bit complexity dependence in running time.\nOverall, the judges' recommendations for the manuscript are mixed.
