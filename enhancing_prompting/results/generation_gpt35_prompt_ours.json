The theoretical analysis demonstrates the importance of calibrating bias-only models for both out-of-distribution and in-distribution model performance. The proposed modification to EBD methods, consisting of adding a calibration step, is well-motivated and practical. The experimental results consistently show that the proposed modification improves the debiased model performance across multiple datasets, calibration methods, and debiasing methods. The paper is well-written and provides a clear and interesting critique of the bias-only model used in two-step debiasing methods.\n\nThe clarity of the paper, the novelty of the findings and method, as well as the thoroughness of the experiments are highlighted. It is mentioned that the empirical gains from the proposed modification are small relative to the gains from standard EBD methods, but the consistency across different experiments and datasets strengthens the significance of the findings.\n\nSome suggestions for improvement include providing a rough range for the threshold in Theorem 1 and clarifying the theoretical notation and statements, especially in relation to debiasing performance.\n\nOverall, the paper makes a significant contribution to the field of ensemble-based debiasing methods and has the potential to serve as a foundational piece for future development."

The experiments demonstrate that RWS consistently outperforms IWAE in learning both generative models and inference networks when the number of particles is increased. The paper provides valuable insights, especially regarding the performance benefits of RWS with increasing particles and its applicability to continuous latent variable models. \n\nThe manuscript is clear and well-written, but there are some clarity issues, such as terminology and explanation of certain concepts, which can be addressed in the updated version. Additionally, the paper lacks a rigorous analysis and explanation for the observations, and there is a need for stronger baselines to provide a more comprehensive comparison.\n\nThe theoretical basis of why RWS is better than IWAE should be further elucidated, and the shortcomings of RWS, as discovered in the GMM experiments, as well as the effectiveness of defensive importance sampling in addressing these issues, should be explored in greater depth.\n\nOverall, the manuscript presents an important problem and offers interesting observations. It contributes to the understanding of the performance of RWS and its potential in learning deep generative models with discrete latent variables. With the incorporation of the suggested improvements, including stronger baselines, rigorous analysis, and deeper exploration of shortcomings and solutions, the manuscript has the potential to make a significant impact in the field."

The paper has been commended for its well-motivated denoising approach, strong and convincing results, and honest discussion of limitations.\n\nHowever, there are some areas for improvement highlighted by the reviewers. Specifically, the evaluations primarily emphasize novel rendering and relighting, while intrinsic components such as 3D geometry and environment mapping are not as thoroughly analyzed. Additionally, the comparison with recent Monte Carlo inverse rendering methods, especially [37], is deemed important for strengthening the paper.\n\nWhile the strengths of the paper have been well-acknowledged, key areas of improvement include a more comprehensive analysis of intrinsic components, a deeper exploration of comparisons with recent Monte Carlo inverse rendering methods, and a clearer alignment of the paper's focus with the target venue.\n\nOverall, the paper provides a promising approach to inverse rendering, and with the suggested improvements, it has the potential to make a valuable contribution to the field."
