The research seems to hold high potential for the fields of unsupervised domain transfer and autonomous driving. The manuscript was perceived as well-structured and engagingly presented.\n\nNevertheless, the reviewers had shared concerns that require attention and resolution. Pseudomarker generation and hard sample discovery were areas where additional details and clarifications were requested. Confusion regarding specific concepts and terminologies, such as cosine similarity versus cosine distance, must be rectified through careful revision and verbose delineation of principle terms and symbols. \n\nTo enhance the comparative evaluation of the proposed method, additional comparative studies with similar works had been recommended. It would be beneficial to explore and explain the potential impact of the proposed method on the standard PV-RCNN. To substantiate the application ventures of the proposed method, one reviewer suggested conducting some synthetic/simulation-to-real generalization experiments where feasible.\n\nIn regards to equations, attention has been drawn to the anomalies in their presentation that needs rectification. Also, the reviewers suggested a comprehensive proofreading of the entire manuscript; helping to sieve out any lingering errors or vagueness and enhancing the overall coherence and flow of the paper.\n\nIn conclusion, considering the concerns addressed through the process of revision, the study appears to hold significant potential and could have a major influence in its field.

While the potential efficacy of this method in improving vision-language pre-training models is noteworthy, its degree of novelty remains a critical point of discussion.\n\nThe reviewers express their concerns about the distinct similarity of this model to existing soft prompt tuning procedures in the NLP domain. This may have considerable implications on the paper's bold claims of uniqueness. Additionally, the term \"context\" used in the context vectors seems to be underspecified, leading to doubts about whether these are merely more parameters for model improvement, rather than true contextual indicators.\n\nPresentational aspects have also been brought up by reviewers, suggesting room for significant enhancement. Contrasting views were voiced about the extensive experiments carried out in the manuscript. While they are indeed hefty and seem to supplement the assertions well, they focus predominantly on the application of CLIP; therefore, they lack the diversity that might be offered by other vision-language models. The reviewers recommended a comparison involving complete fine-tuning of CLIP parameters, which would allow more comprehensive insights into the hypothetical advantages of the context optimization approach.\n\nThe critiques further extend to the authors' rationale that prompt engineering is time-consuming. This suggestion by the writers has been contested by one of the reviewers, who instead proposes to orient the focus towards increasing model resilience to minor changes in prompts. Finally, a reviewer highlighted that from a presentational standpoint, several areas need significant improvement, including inappropriate claims, lack of clarity in various areas, and the presentation and justification of figures.\n\nIn light of these thorough reviews, it seems prudent to encourage further discussion among the reviewers, aiming at a better alignment of opinions. Should the overall sentiment lean towards acceptance, it would be imperative for the authors to address the points of criticisms and suggestions provided here, particularly those concerning the clarity of the 'context' concept, the question of novelty, and the need for a diverse range of experimental procedures. With these improvements, the authors stand a promising chance of enhancing their manuscript to be more robust and convincing."

Additionally, the authors delve into the concept of \"phase transitions\", demonstrating that small increments in agent capability can lead to a significant change in behavior and a decline in true rewards. The authors provide an important contribution towards understanding reward hacking, an issue that has remained complex and understudied, despite its significance in AI safety.\n\nAll reviewers acknowledge the relevance and importance of this study. They have identified areas where further work is needed, such as justifying the choice of environments and proxy-true reward pairs. They have also recommended improvements to aid the readers' comprehension. \n\nThe feedback from the reviewers was not contradictory and focused on how the manuscript could be improved. Some noted concerns about the settings of the environments, stressing the need for more realistic settings for experiments and calling for a better selection of reward functions, choosing those that are very close to the true reward function. There were also calls for the formalization of the concepts of reward hacking and phase transitions.\n\nWhile the authors have responded to many of these suggestions, some concerns still remain, including worries about the methodology and choice of experiments and environments. The reviewers found fault with the arbitrary choice of proxy and true rewards in some environments and called for a more nuanced and justified selection of these rewards.\n\nThe authors' effort to address these concerns has been acknowledged. However, further clarification and refinement on the choice of environments and rewards, as well as a thorough related-work overview, have been suggested by the reviewers. \n\nBased on this consensus, it is recommended that the authors take steps to address these lingering issues.

The proposed approach involves using a warping operation that transforms a predicted mask to one that matches the ground truth mask topologically and computes a pixelwise cross-entropy on the points of disagreement between the target and warped source masks. The paper is clearly written and mathematically sound in its presentation. In addition to this, the efficient implementation of the algorithm and its evaluation on a diverse set of datasets (both 2D and 3D) is commendable. Specifically, the evaluation finds the algorithm to perform strongly on datasets where preservation of connectivity structure is critical.\n\nRegarding the criticisms, the reviewers raised certain issues. These include the potential limitations of the algorithm if the segmentation output is noisy, minor proposed terminology improvements, the ability to generalize the approach to multiclass problems, and a perceived lack of detailed failure-mode analyses. The reviewers also suggested experimenting with different ways to binarize the mask or select pixels for warping, the necessity of which is not directly addressed in the manuscript. \n\nMoreover, the improvement made by the proposed method, although palpable, remains relatively slight in some empirical evaluations (with a 1% improvement in Dice score in most experiments). Finally, the reviewers have noted certain grammatical errors and a need for clearer statements in places.\n\nIn response to the reviews, the authors have been invited to elaborate on these criticisms in the manuscript, which could strengthen the potential contribution of this work. Considerations for future work might include experimentation with other architectures, more comprehensive failure analyses, and more specific attention to clarifying terminology.\n\nOverall, the originality and simplicity of the proposed approach, coupled with its strong performance on varied datasets, makes this work a valuable contribution to the field. It is hoped that the authors can address the reviewers' criticisms and continue to refine this promising approach. The final decision of acceptance will predominantly depend on how well authors address the weaknesses pointed out by reviewers. It is recommended that the authors be invited for a revision of the manuscript. \n\nFeedback to reviewers: The reviewers ' comments were constructive and thorough, providing helpful areas of focus for the authors to address in subsequent revisions.

Detailed Analysis: On the positive side, reviewers commended the paper for exploring a novel and important problem in the field of model explanation. The paper's theoretical results, the proposed detection method, and the comprehensive empirical evaluation were appreciated. Conversely, the reviewers raised issues with the clarity of terms including the definition of an \"interpretable model,\" what constitutes \"completely eliminating fairwashing,\" and the \"sufficiency\" of the method. One reviewer also criticized the assumption about the defender's knowledge as unrealistic.\n\n4. Author Responses: The authors responded to the concerns raised by the reviewers, providing additional clarification for the queries. They also promised to add extra results regarding equalized odds in the updated appendix.\n\n5.

The authors have conducted extensive experimentation which is commendable. However, the reviewers have raised several significant concerns that need to be taken into account.\n\nThe main issues pertain to the lack of novelty and practical significance in the paper. The reviewers noted that while the autoencoder concept is interesting, there does not appear to be a significant differentiation from existing literature. Clarification and justification for certain methodological choices, such as the selection of decoder sizes and the training dataset percentage for the autoencoder, are lacking. This unclear methodology is seen as a major concern with the potential for undermining the scientific soundness of the study. \n\nThe evaluation metrics came under scrutiny as it primarily relies on rouge scores. The inclusion of other metrics, such as BLEU or BERTscore, would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the model's performance. The paper also falls short in terms of comparing against robust baselines. The performance of the current baseline is notably different from what is reported in existing literature, raising further questions regarding the paper's validity. Additionally, a comparison with other compression techniques is missing, which would be essential to support the paper's relevance.\n\nIn light of these concerns, the consensus among the reviewers is to reject the paper in its current form.

The key offering that the paper brings to the fore is its robust theoretical approach, with the crowning jewel being Theorem 1. However, the practical validation of the theoretical approach through empirical investigation seems to get mixed reviews.\n\nLooking at the individual reviews in aggregate, all the reviewers commend the strong theoretical underpinnings of the paper. The primary attention surrounds Theorem 1, which engages the reviewers, with one reviewer reading through the proofs and finding them to be accurate. However, Reviewer 1 raises some fundamental questions around theoretical inaccuracies in the proof of a theorem in the appendix. This discrepancy warrants deliberations and potential amendments to the paper.\n\nA shared critique from Reviewers 2 and 3 surrounds the empirical evaluation, perceived as limited and lacking in a broader context.

It would be beneficial to broaden the range of the experimental section by including more diverse datasets, presenting a wall-clock comparison between methods, and reevaluating the usage of likelihoods for evaluating models.\n\nA particular area where the model may underperform is in imputation tasks on image processing data, as highlighted by one reviewer. This potential limitation should be addressed in further studies.\n\nIn conclusion, provided the authors make the suggested revisions, this paper should be accepted for publication. The authors' willingness to engage with the feedback and clarify their approach is commendable.

This has been identified as an issue in previous models like ACGAN. The authors introduce a novel auxiliary discriminative classifier to deal with the undesirable divergence and conditional entropy in ACGAN training, which is suggested to improve the learning of joint distribution and increase the intra-class diversity of the generated images.\n\nReviewers applauded the insightful and theoretical analysis of ACGAN, complementing the seamless integration of the auxiliary discriminative classifier and the streamlined deployment of the new classifier on the ACGAN framework. Furthermore, the proposed method is described as straightforward and computationally efficient.\n\nHowever, there are concerns about the proof of Theorem 2, and some reviewers asked the authors to clarify the mathematical relations. A major criticism is about the similarity between the proposed ADC-GAN and TAC-GAN; the technical differences were not sufficiently elucidated. Also, some reviewers argued that due to the substantial number of experimental results on different benchmarks and datasets, it became harder to validate the claims regarding the effectiveness of ADC-GAN.\n\nDuring the rebuttal, the authors address these issues effectively and provide insights into the auxiliary discriminative classifier and its implementation, resolving much of the reviewers' doubts regarding the similarity between ADC-GAN and TAC-GAN. Nevertheless, some concerns remained, particularly about the difference between the auxiliary discriminative classifier and the discriminator and classifier hybrid model currently in AC-GAN and about the necessity of further diversification experiments.\n\nIn terms of the overall manuscript quality, it is evident that the authors offer a well-motivated and insightful perspective on improving conditional GANs. Despite the reservations and further explorations suggested by the reviewers, the novel auxiliary discriminative classifier's introduction paves the way for potentially impactful advances in GANs.\n\nRecommendation encompasses revisiting the mathematical proofs and theorem formulations and addressing the questions raised by the reviewers, in addition to conducting additional diversification experiments if feasible. By refining and validating the claims made about the auxiliary discriminative classifier, the value of this work would be highlighted further. Overall, the authors' swift response helped address many of the initial concerns and bolstered confidence in the ADC-GAN model. However, careful attention to some of the remaining issues is advised before reaching a final decision about publication."

Specifically, the authors' proposes an approach to replace the keypoint-based matching component of OnePose with the keypoint-free matching method LoFTR. The goal is to better estimate the pose of low-texture objects. Additionally, a new dataset named OnePose-HARD is introduced, which includes low-texture objects along with their pose annotations.\n\n2. Highlights of the Reviews:\nAll three reviewers recognize that the application of keypoint-free matching represents a logical extension of prior work and can improve performance for low-texture objects. They equally acknowledge the quality of the paper's structure and the clarity of the experiment design. However, there are concerns about the novelty of the keypoint-free Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithm, the comparison with existing work, and the classification of the OnePose++ as a \"generalizable object pose estimation method\". Critically, the reviewers questioned the claims of significant execution speed improvements and seek clarification.\n\n3. Addressing Individual Reviews:\nReviewers 1 and 2 question the novelty of the proposed SfM approach and raises concerns about possible overlap with existing work, such as Dusmanu et al.\u2019s multi-view optimization of local feature geometry. Reviewer 2 also asks for comparisons with Patch2Pix and Dual RCNet, and calls for more context around SfM-based object pose estimation and visual localization works. Reviewer 3 suggests that example images of the OnePose-HARD dataset should be included in the paper and asks for clarification on how performance numbers for other methods were determined.\n\n4. Discuss Controversial Issues:\nA key point of contention is the novelty of the keypoint-free SfM method proposed in the paper. While the authors claim significant contributions in expanding the OnePose approach, reviewers have expressed skepticism, citing overlap with existing work. Further, two reviewers disagree with the authors' claim that OnePose++ qualifies as a \"generalizable\" approach since specific target object and its video recording is a prerequisite. There is a request for empirical evidence to support the claim of faster execution times.\n\n5. Author Responses:\nThe authors should clearly address the concerns raised by the reviewers about the novelty of their approach, especially in relation to other keypoint-free methods. They should also engage with the requests for additional experiments, if feasible, to compare their method with the likes of Patch2Pix and Dual RCNet. Additionally, the claims of being a \"generalizable\" approach and the speed improvements should be substantiated or appropriately revised.\n\n6. Guidance for Editors:\nBased on the reviews, the paper makes valid contributions to the fields of pose estimation and image matching. Despite issues around the novelty and general applicability of the approach, the paper is methodologically sound and clearly written. The authors\u2019 responses to the reviewers' concerns will be pivotal in determining the final recommendation.\n\n7. Guidance for Authors:\nThe authors should thoroughly address the concerns raised by the reviewers in their rebuttal. Effort should be placed on demonstrating the novelty of the keypoint-free SfM approach in relation to existing work and on substantiating the general applicability and speed improvement claims.\n\n8. Conclusion:\nIn essence, the authors make important strides in the field of object pose estimation, specifically for low-texture objects. However, certain claims and comparisons made in the paper require more substantiation or adjustment, and maintaining transparency and clarity in the discussion of prior work will ensure a stronger paper."

This manuscript introduces a novel method for detecting underdetermination when a predictive model is extrapolating to test points, using an extrapolation score based on the variance of predictions across models with similar training loss. This is achieved using local ensembles, which represent models with perturbations in regions of the loss surface with minimal curvature determined by the eigenvectors of the Hessian.\n\n2. The reviewers agreed that the methodology is novel and interesting, particularly in the use of local ensembles to detect underdetermination. There was appreciation for the potential efficiency of this post-hoc technique compared to other ensemble methods. The theoretic stability of the proposed method compared to full Hessian inversion was viewed as an advantage.\n\n3. There was agreement among the reviewers that the paper lacks clarity in positioning against other methods in the literature, specifically Gal & Ghahramani, and Blundell et al., which also employ local ensembles. One review suggested these methods were not fully compared with, and the paper provided insufficient rationale for this exclusion. Responding to the argument about the paper being more efficient and stable than alternatives, one review noted a lack of comparison with full Hessian inversion and MC-dropout. \n\n4. Reviewers consistently suggested a more detailed analysis of the paper's efficiency against alternative approximations of ensembles, and a performance comparison to ensemble and local Bayesian methods. \n\n5. Opinions regarding the paper's acceptance were varied. Two reviewers recommended acceptance given the paper's novel contributions in theory and the potential benefits in efficiency and stability over other methods. However, one reviewer gave a weak rejection due to the lack of comprehensive comparison with similar methodologies and a lack of experimental proof to support the paper\u2019s efficiency claims.\n\n6. Certain organizational and clarity issues were highlighted, such as typographical errors, unclear axis labels in figures, and experimental details that were relegated to the appendix, making it difficult to follow.\n\n7. In conclusion, the paper has merit in presenting a novel methodology for underdetermination detection in models, but has shortcomings in positioning the method against existing literature, and in providing comprehensive experimental comparison and analysis. These issues should be addressed in a revision."

Introduction: The authors in this manuscript aim to assess the capacity of unsupervised and semi-supervised Disentangled Representation Learning (DGL) algorithms to produce high-grade concept-based representations. To this end, they developed two metrics designed to compare concept-based representations both with and without ground truth concept labels. They evaluated these metrics by applying various state-of-the-art concept-based and DGL algorithms, with and without concept supervision.\n\n2. Key Findings: Most reviewers appreciated the innovative proposal for new metrics that can evaluate the quality of concept-based representations induced by Concept Learning (CL) and DGL methods. These metrics, namely Oracle Impurity Score (OIS) and Niching Scores (NS), were appreciated for being valuable tools that can handle correlations in underlying factors. This ability was marked as an often-overlooked yet crucial aspect in the literature. Nevertheless, uncertainties remain regarding the niching score's rationale, and some of the Oracle Impurity Score's details were seen as potentially heuristic or arbitrary.\n\n3. Points of Disagreement: Opinions diverged on the novelty and significance of the results derived from the experiments. Some reviewers found the outcomes to be expected or unsurprising, arguing that the natural intuition is that supervised learning of concepts yields better results. Conversely, some reviewers saw value in the robust experimental approach, despite the seeming predictability of the results.\n\n4. Areas of Improvement: Reviewers indicated some areas in which the manuscript could be improved. These included clarifying the role of downstream tasks, aligning the descriptions of Concept Learning (CL) and Disentangled Learning (DGL) terminology and assumptions, and whether the paper's aim was to unify or contrast the two methods. There were also calls for a clearer explanation of how the metrics (especially niching scores) were calculated and offering a more rigorous definition or justification for the chosen methods' parameters.\n\n5. Response Evaluation: The authors' responses addressed several of the raised critiques and provided useful clarifications. Many reviewers, however, were not fully satisfied with the authors' explanations, especially regarding the choice of AUC for the OIS and the rationale behind the niching scores.\n\n6. Final Recommendation: Given the feedback received from the reviewers, and their subsequent discussions, I recommend that the paper be reconsidered for publication after significant revisions are made. \n\n7. Closing Remarks: I strongly urge the authors to take into account all the insightful comments provided by the reviewers. By attending to these concerns and focusing on the coherent presentation of their research and methodologies, the authors will significantly improve their manuscript's quality and impact, allowing their original contributions to the field to stand out more effectively."

Also, a more granular explanation of how the authors obtained metrics for the multi-class problem would strengthen the paper.\n \nA central issue raised by the reviewers is the unrealistic experiment settings. Addressing this is crucial as it undermines the paper's validity. In particular, the presupposed knowledge of candidate CNV positions significantly limits the practicality of the proposed method. This issue needs to be rectified, and a more reasonable solution provided.\n \nFurthermore, the process of comparing CNV-Net with other existing methods was unclear and potentially biased in favor of the proposed method. Fully explaining the comparison process, including what versions of other tools were used, their setups, and specific arguments, will improve the paper's credibility.\n \nHowever, the paper is not without its strengths. The empirical results are promising, showing improved accuracy over existing baselines. Additionally, the method presented is attractive for its speed and apparent ease of implementation.\n \nIn light of these points, I recommend the authors to revise the paper significantly in accordance with the reviewers' comments."

The reviewers unanimously appreciated the solid work and clear presentation. They have acknowledged the improved efficiency of EPD computation and its potential impact on future topological data analysis (TDA) research.\n\nStrengths highlighted by reviewers:\n\n1. The analysis and construction of algorithms to improve the efficiency of EPD calculation were appreciated. \n2. The authors provided an effective evaluation of their method (success in graph analysis, and computation time improvements).\n\nHowever, several pertinent questions and concerns were raised:\n\nQuestions regarding the training loss implementation, its computational burden and benefits from edge-decomposition properties, were frequently mentioned. To address these concerns, the authors are encouraged to provide a more detailed and explicit explanation of how the Wasserstein distance was naturally decomposed into the supervision loss for each edge to improve learning efficiency.\n\nMoreover, the possibility of redundancy using PIE as a second evaluation metric was raised, which the authors should address.\n\nThe authors are also encouraged to provide evidence of the superiority of EPD over other TDA methods or at least discuss its relative performance. Furthermore, the extension of EPD decomposition to simplicial complexes, the choice of filter functions, and experiments on real-world or synthetic graphs were brought up as opportunities to improve the experimental completeness.\n\nConcerns were also raised about the methodology's limited application to specific types of graphs. Experimenting with sparser, large-scale, real-world graphs, such as brain connectomes, may improve the generalizability of the findings.\n\nThe authors are encouraged to include references to other works on similar topics, such as \"Learning persistent homology of 3D point clouds\" and \"RipsNet: a general architecture for fast and robust estimation of the persistent homology of point clouds\", as well as reflecting on the limitations of their approach in the discussion of their manuscript.\n\nOverall, the reviewers support the publication of the manuscript with these above issues addressed, recognising the novelty and potential impact of the approach. The authors' work in decomposing the PD computation into different algorithmic steps and designing a GNN to learn to reproduce this sub-routine is deemed commendable. The collective assessment emphasizes the novelty and significance of this research, suggesting it should be considered seriously following revisions."

Moreover, it provides an integrative insight into the performance of past methods within this framework, which is highly appreciated.\n\nHowever, some critical points of divergence amongst the reviewers were noted. While a few suggested further strengthening of the empirical justification with the help of more illustrations and an example, others expressed concerns about the theoretical explanations of the proposed method, particularly in relation to Eq 4. One reviewer questioned the use of $Q_{\\theta}$ as an anchor, arguing that it might be optimizing the anchor rather than pushing $P_{\\theta}(Y|\\widetilde{X})$ towards $P(Y|X)$, which lead to a conflict.\n\nIn response to these conflicts, it would be beneficial for the authors to provide a detailed explanation of their method surrounding Eq 4 and address the concerns raised concerning the use of $Q_{\\theta}$ as an anchor. \n\nGiven the novel approach and encouraging results, the recommendation for the authors leans towards acceptance of the paper, provided they address the concerns raised by the reviewers.

The use of 'experts' in the model is also questioned by a reviewer, who asked for a clear explanation on the decision of using this approach that ultimately simplified the study. \n\nThere is also a general consensus among the reviewers over the need to enhance the experiment design and comparison - it is recommended that more experimental results gathered through diverse environments and by comparing BRPO to a plethora of exploration methods are provided. \n\nFurthermore, the current task-specific approach of the model is seen to limit its applicability to a wider array of tasks. In this regard, the reviewers called for more clarity on the premise of the experiments and its rewarding system. The clarity in the explanation of algorithm 1, including a detailed analysis of batch policy optimization, is also seen as a significant area for improvement.\n\nTherefore, for the paper to be considered for publication, it is imperative that the authors address all the raised points.

First and foremost, the novelty of your model is called into question. While your work differentiates MetaD2A from traditional metaNAS and clearly outlines its three primary components, the lack of innovation within each of these components means that the originality of your model as a whole could be seen as lacking. To address this criticism, it will be important to highlight the unique aspects or innovations that MetaD2A brings to the field, beyond what has already been achieved by existing models. \n\nMoreover, there are concerns about your experiment design and the benchmarks used for comparison. Reviewers suggest a broader comparative analysis with other methods of fast NAS adaptation. They also propose that you extend your performance comparisons beyond the random baseline in your ablation study. Additionally, the need for your model to generate different types of edge connections, and to effectively verify the functionality of the edge decoding part of your model, has been highlighted.\n\nThe fairness of the comparison drawn in Table 1, where the pretrained MetaD2A is benchmarked against baselines trained from scratch, has also been raised as a concern. To overcome this issue, you could present comparisons with other MetaNAS methods that follow the same training procedure as MetaD2A.\n\nDespite these concerns, reviewers have acknowledged the promising direction of your work and complimented the clarity of your paper.

The model uses recursive decomposition to hierarchically break down a scene into objects and infer parts of the objects resulting in a tree-like structure. \n\n2. Summary of Reviews:\nThe reviewers agree on the importance and novelty of the author's proposed direction and that the methodology appears sound. They praise the clarity of the paper and its effectiveness in addressing the tasks on the chosen datasets. Some weaknesses have been identified, including the simplicity of the datasets used, the need for stronger downstream task utility of the learned scene graphs, and concerns about the scalability of the model to more complex and realistic datasets. A common concern raised by all reviewers is that the experiments are conducted on carefully chosen synthetic datasets that ideally fit the model's assumptions.\n\n3. Discussion of Controversial Points:\nWhile reviewers agree on certain points, there is a difference of opinion regarding the datasets used. Some reviewers don't find this an issue, considering the novel nature of the task and lack of supervision. Others are more critical, highlighting the complexity and real-world applicability of the model as potential concerns.\n\n4. Key Issues:\nThe key issues highlighted by the reviewers include: \n    i) The use of very simplistic datasets that perfectly match the model\u2019s assumptions.\n    ii) Absence of comprehensive experiments demonstrating model scalability and applicability to more varied and complex datasets. \n    iii) Lack of clarity about certain implementation details. \n    iv) The utility of the learned scene graph for downstream tasks. \n\n5. Response to Rebuttal:\nThe author's rebuttal generally answers and addresses the concerns raised by the reviewers. The authors provide additional experiments which appeases some concerns. They also clarified some of the unclear implementation details. However, the rebuttal didn't fully address the primary concerns of scalability and real-world utility of the model.\n\n6. Conclusion:\nThe manuscript has a significant contribution in hierarchical scene graph learning but faces challenges in demonstrating its applicability beyond controlled, synthetic datasets. Although the authors provided additional experiments and clarifications in their rebuttal, critiques related to utility and scalability still hold relevance.\n\n7. Recommendations:\nFurther, the authors could bolster their research by conducting more comprehensive evaluations on complex, real-world datasets. By demonstrating the model's utility in these conditions, as well as its potential for application in downstream tasks, the authors could address the primary concerns raised by reviewers. It is recommended that the manuscript be reconsidered after these improvements have been made."

Additionally, the reviewers agreed on the novelty and value introduced by the predefined merge resolution patterns. It was a consensus between the reviewers that the problem space addressed in the paper is crucial and has substantial practical implications.\n\nHowever, a forefront concern raised by the reviewers is the lack of a novel machine-learning contribution in the paper. The use of BERT in the proposed solution was seen as a minor adaptation. Relatedly, the reviewers indicate trouble understanding how the original BERT model was adapted and fine-tuned for this specific task. They suggest a detailed explanation of this would enhance the quality of the paper.\n\nThe fairness of the comparison with the DeepMerge model is another topic that the reviewers unanimously raised. There is a potential problem that the comparison lacks generality since the model comparison includes cases where DeepMerge cannot produce a prediction. They recommend rectifying this in a revised version of the paper.\n\nFurthermore, a common suggestion from the reviewers is enhancing the experimental evaluation of the model by providing an extensive ablation study. An examination of the metrics - precision, recall, and BLEU-4 - is equally valuable for better comprehension. The reviewers have also pointed out ambiguities in the paper figures and the validation process of the determined nine merge patterns.\n\nTaking into account the feedback from the reviewers, it appears the paper provides value and contributes to a significant real-world problem but requires major revisions before it is suitable for publication. The authors are encouraged to address the raised concerns, with a specific focus on amplifying their machine-learning contribution, providing clearer explanatory details on the BERT adaptation, offering a fair comparison with the DeepMerge model, and extending the experimental evaluation."

Strengths: The consensus among reviewers is that the paper presents a theoretical contribution to a classic problem \u2013 online bipartite matching. The paper is considered well-written, with comprehensive experimental studies and solid theoretical proofs. Particularly highlighted is the novelty of the proposed MinPredictedDegree algorithm and the analysis of its performance in CLV-B graphs. The authors' thoroughness in discussing various factors, such as prediction errors and different graph models, was also acknowledged.\n\n2. Weaknesses: Several issues were raised, chief among them the validity of the prediction aspect posed in the introductory sections. Reviewers argue that the paper essentially deals with a combinatorial optimization problem, and the role of prediction (which often implies inaccuracy) is not adequately established, given that perfect knowledge of expected degrees seems to be assumed for much of the analysis. The connection of this work to the community of Machine Learning is felt to be weak, leading some reviewers to suggest that forums focusing on theoretical computer science might be a better fit. Concerns were also raised about the paper not detailing how its findings build or deviate from existing work, especially in light of the similarity to known graph models.\n\n3. Key Areas of Discrepancy: While all reviewers acknowledge the paper's theoretical robustness and well-conducted experimental studies, their perspectives significantly differ in terms of the paper's relevance to NeurIPS and the clarity of its novelty. Some reviewers call for a clearer explanation of how this paper innovates beyond the findings of existing literature on online bipartite matching and graph models.\n\n4. Recommendations: In light of the discussed issues, it is recommended that the authors address the questions raised about the predictive aspect of their work and how this ties into the practical application of their findings. Emphasizing the connection between this work and machine learning will improve its alignment with NeurIPS. Furthermore, discussing how their proofs are inspired by or deviate from existing proofs would give clearer context to their contribution. \n\n5. Final Verdict: Given the objections related to the paper's fit with NeurIPS and lack of clarity about its novelty beyond existing work, it might be prudent to lean towards rejection for this venue. However, the robustness of the theoretical and experimental work presented in the paper means it could be more suitable for submission to a conference more aligned with theoretical computer science."

The approach leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract object masks, a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to turn these masks into feature vectors, and a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to estimate an action-conditioned delta for each feature. Every step in the process aims to optimize the nearby feature space with respect to a contrastive loss in an efficient and effective manner. Importantly, the method works well in synthetic environments.\n\nThe reviewers find the paper to be well-written and methodically sound. They commend the clarity and ease of understanding of the method, and appreciate the straightforwardness of the evaluation process. The fact that the present method outperforms previous models in terms of nearest neighbors in the feature space is considered a significant advantage. Additionally, they appreciate the lattice-like structure evident in PCA compressions of the model's state as an indication of the accuracy in segmenting objects.\n\nHowever, some concerns have been raised. First, some reviewers pointed out that the sensitivity of results on the number of object slots (K) could be a limitation. Second, despite the high H@1 and MRR scores, questions persist on the real-world applicability of the method as the goal should ideally be to improve performance or sample efficiency in some downstream task. Third, the choice of outputting only a scalar mask in the object extractor has raised some questions, with suggestions to allow the encoder to output more features per objects.\n\nIn response to reviewers' queries, the authors have provided an extensively detailed rebuttal, conducting additional experiments, clarifying concerns around the sensitive to 'K' values and offering the potential for future research in automating this hyperparameter. It also appears that the model is not overly sensitive to misspecification of this value. \n\nTake into account all the reviewers' comments and authors' responses, I would recommend the acceptance of this paper. The proposed method is novel, pertinent, and represents a noteworthy advancement in the field of learning structured latent representations. However, it would be beneficial to explicitly address the issues and suggestions proposed by the reviewers in the final version of the manuscript. Offering more clarifications on the areas of concern, deepening the analysis of the model's performance, and discussing potential improvements and future research directions can significantly enhance the manuscript."

Reviewer Consensus: There is a general consensus among the reviews that while the subject of explanation for similarity learners is significant and the methods proposed are novel, there are serious concerns regarding the experiments and the evaluation approach of this study.\n\n3. Diverging Opinions: The reviewers differ in their assessment of the qualitative and quantitative analysis. Some reviewers find the examples helpful in understanding the methods, while others raise concerns about the user study design and question the convincingness of the presented examples. The generalizability of this method and comparison with more baselines are other issues where opinions vary among the reviewers.\n\n4. Important Issues: Major concerns brought up by the reviewers involve the game-ability of the user study design. They argue that a fully meaningful evaluation necessitates the explanation's absence when participants are replicating the model's behaviors. Another point raised is the need for a better comparison with other methods such as LIME, RISE and SHAPE, etc, in terms of multiple metrics, not just fidelity. \n\n5. Authors' Reactions: The authors have engaged with the reviewer comments during the rebuttal phase. They have offered clarifications on their methodology while promising to take into account the constructive feedback in their future work. There is a lack of consensus among the reviewers about whether the authors' responses comprehensively address their concerns.\n\n6. Evaluation of Reviews: The reviews are largely comprehensive, detailed and unbiased. They address important aspects of the manuscript and provide an accurate assessment of its strengths and weaknesses. \n\n7. Recommendations: Based on the reviews, concerns raised, and authors' responses, a major revision is recommended. The authors should reassess their evaluation approach, especially the user study design, and consider using additional comparative baselines while addressing the raised concerns.\n\n8. Guidelines for Revision: The authors need to revisit their user study design to ensure a non-gameable testing environment. They should provide a clearer motivation for their choice of examples and offer better insight into the benefits and limitations of their proposed explanation techniques.

The proposed method takes a fresh perspective, utilizing Figalli's regularity theory, and proves to be effective in the empirical results produced, standing on par with, or even exceeding, current state-of-the-art methodologies.\n\nThe reviews commend the unique perspective the paper presents and recognize its numerical contributions. Both reviewers agree on the complexity involved in the singular point detection method and bring forth concerns about the heavy dependence on a high-quality auto-encoder model. Further issues were raised about the absence of an adversarial training module and the simplifying assumptions made in the paper which may lead to sub-optimal visual results.\n\nA point of divergence between the reviewers is their conclusion about the novelty of the work. While one reviewer considers the proposal to be groundbreaking and worthy of publication, the other suggests that the importance of the work may be overstated, as it relies heavily on existing technologies and does not present significant improvements over existing GAN methodologies.\n\nMajor criticisms include the need for clearer explanations and simplification of notation. The use of different algorithmic terms, namely Newton's method, gradient descent, and Adam, is pointed out as confusing. The explicit details of how the authors aimed to deal with the non-differentiability of the gradient could have been expounded upon. Additionally, the paper would benefit from a thorough proofreading for grammatical errors and typos.\n\nOverall, the manuscript shows potential and brings an interesting take on GANs. However, considerable revisions are recommended. The authors need to clarify the methodology and provide a more intuitive explanation of the singular point detection process. They should consider simplifying the notation used and explain the usage of the different algorithmic terms. Moreover, a narrative that highlights how their work significantly improves over existing GAN methodologies hinges on its success. A thorough round of proofreading to eliminate errors and ensure clarity is also advised."

The paper provides a solution to an issue identified with the importance-weighted autoencoder (IWAE) in which tighter lower bounds developed from increasing the number of particles improve the learning of the generative model but worsen the learning of the inference network. Through a series of experiments, the authors demonstrate the efficacy and potential advantages of the RWS system.\n\nAll reviewers commend the authors for addressing an essential problem and concur that the manuscript's presentation is largely accessible and appealing, particularly in terms of its insightful discourse and extensive experiments. It shines a spotlight on the superiority of RWS over IWAE in certain key areas, particularly with greater particle numbers, which paves an intriguing avenue of academic exploration.\n\nHowever, reviewers also raised concerns regarding the paper's clarity, in light of the usage of unfamiliar terminologies as well as the presentation of certain challenging concepts, which may hinder comprehensive understanding. As such, clearer explanations and better definitions are encouraged for these segments. Moreover, while the authors have conducted several experiments to demonstrate their thesis, there is a perceived lack of rigorous analysis providing a concrete reason for RWS's superior performance over IWAE. \n\nThe reviewers have also expressed some doubts about different aspects of the experiments, highlighting the need for clarification on some of the calculated metrics and received performance results. Furthermore, a crucial recommendation from the reviewers is to include stronger baselines in the experiments, and additional investigations into current RWS limitations uncovered in the GMM experiments.\n\nAnother potential area of improvement suggested by the reviewers includes the scope of the experiments. The current body of research relies heavily on MNIST and synthetic data, but reviewers suggest that diversifying this range, particularly including more real-world datasets and applications, could strengthen the study.\n\nIn conclusion, the reviewers agree that the paper is certainly contributing to the discussion around this topic, but they believe it could be improved by addressing the issues they've raised and integrating their suggestions. Accordingly, necessary revisions and updates should be made by the authors, prior to reconsideration for publication."

However, there are numerous deliberations with varying viewpoints presented by the reviewers that need to be addressed.\n\nFirstly, there is a contention regarding the new notion brought forward by the authors as \"inverted dot-product attention\". According to one reviewer, this is not a newly introduced concept and is a part of an existing dynamic routing process. This requires further clarification and justification from the authors' end. Along with this, the reviewers highlighted the lack of comparison with dynamic routing CapsNet in the multiMNIST experiment, which is a baseline for this study. \n\nThe manuscript also stirred a debate concerning the learning rate schedules for all models. The reviewers observed potential inconsistencies in the schedules and questioned the fairness of utilizing the same hyper-parameters tuned for the proposed model on the baselines. This would need further explanation as well.\n\nMention of the network's viewpoint generalizability promises also caught reviewers' attention, asking the authors to provide substantial evidence to back their claims through experiments.

However, there are several concerns raised by reviewers that need to be taken into consideration.\n\nThe most common theme amongst the reviews is the lack of novelty in the presented approach. All reviewers noted that this work relies heavily on previous work and doesn't introduce new ideas or methods, but rather extends the prior networks to regression tasks. Hence, there is a recurring question on the novelty and originality of this work, despite the problem being addressed is undoubtedly relevant.\n\nReviewers also raise concerns over the lack of comparison with alternative methods for estimating prediction uncertainty such as Bayesian neural networks and other efficient ensemble or lifelong learning methods. Furthermore, there are concerns about the use of out-of-domain dataset in training, the sensitivity to the training parameters chosen, and the overall clarity around the experiment descriptions and the performance criteria used.\n\nIn the rebuttal and author responses, the authors attempted to address these concerns, but it is unclear if they were all sufficiently addressed to the satisfaction of all reviewers. There is also a divergence in the final recommendations from the reviewers, from weak acceptance to rejection based on the limited novelty and the issues raised.\n\nIn my overall assessment, while the paper addresses an important problem in the field of neural networks and is praised for its simplicity and broad empirical validation, the significant reliance on previous work and lack propper references to equivalent alternatives lacking in novelty and originality significantly weaken this paper. Further justification for the choice of parameters, better clarity on the datasets and their use in training, as well as a fair comparison with alternative methods could strengthen this work.\n\nGiven the above, the recommendation would be to consider these concerns and make necessary improvements and clarifications.

The authors suggest three types of logit calibrations - temperature-based, margin-based, and angle-based - which intend to increase the logit margins between targeted and non-targeted classes. The proposed approach has been tested on the ImageNet dataset and is compared with state-of-the-art methods.\n\n2. Overview of the Reviews: Several reviewers highlight the clear writing style and interesting findings as strengths of the manuscript. However, concerns are raised around the novelty of the work given the similarity to a previous work [1] and the lack of a substantial improvement over [1]. Moreover, worries are expressed about the limitations of the experimental section, the limited theoretical analysis, and the need to choose among logit calibration options for achieving the highest attack success rate.\n\n3. Addressing Disagreements: While all reviewers agreed on the paper's clarity and interesting findings, they show significant divergence regarding the novelty of the work and its similarity to [1]. One reviewer noted a \u201chuge amount of overlapping\u201d with work [1], which makes it unprofessional and destroys the overall quality of the work, and recommends rejection of the paper. Another reviewer, however, didn't perceive this overlapping as a serious issue and praised the paper's significant and novel contribution. \n\n4. Providing a Balanced View: Overall, reviewers appreciated the paper's clarity and found the results interesting. However, issues around novelty, experimental limitation, limited theoretical analysis, and some potential grammar and context mistakes were raised, and need to be addressed for the paper to be considered for publication.\n\n5. Highlight Changes: The authors were given an opportunity to revise the paper. The changes made influenced some reviewers to change their initial rating. However, the reviewers concurred that the changes aligned with a major revision of the manuscript, which falls outside the scope of the conference.\n\n6. Author Response: The authors' responses to the reviewers' comments are yet to be summarized.\n\n7. Conclusion: Given the review process and the consensus among the reviewers, the primary concerns regarding the paper relate to its novelty and significant overlap with previous work. Further, the lack of strong theoretical support and need for additional experimental results was also raised. Given these concerns, revising the paper with additional experimental tests, theoretical analysis, and clarification of logit calibration choices for attack success rate could help improve the work.\n\n8. Suggestions for the authors: It is recommended for the authors to consider the concerns regarding the novelty, overlap with previous work, and providing clear distinctions between their work and previous work [1]. A comprehensive theoretical analysis supporting their empirical findings, as well as an extended experimental section, may address some of the concerns raised by the reviewers. The authors are also recommended to provide a more distinct explanation of the different types of logit calibration. Finally, revising the manuscript for grammatical and context errors could enhance the paper's overall quality."

Address Specific Comments: One point of discussion centred on the advantage of using a Hamiltonian flow over other normalizing flows, with the reviewers suggesting the ability to converge to a target posterior distribution and enabling the use of a core set. There was also a question about the potential of other expressive flows in providing better empirical results, which could be addressed by the authors in future work. \n\n6. Evaluate: Given the strength of the methodology and the supportive evidence provided, it seems the paper has made a significant contribution to the subject. However, its potential limitations with complex models and datasets should have been more explicitly discussed.\n\n7. Provide Recommendations: From the above analysis, I recommend that this paper should be accepted with minor revisions. The authors should incorporate the feedback from the reviewers, especially in discussing the limitations and assumptions of their method, and consider providing context around their choice of Hamiltonian flow. The authors may also consider adding more diverse experiments, particularly those involving complex data sets and models, if it is within their scope."

        "generation": "Overall, based on the reviewers' feedback and discussions, the manuscript \"Defending Against Machine Learning Copyright Infringement by Rendering Data Unlearnable\" is considered to offer an interesting and novel method in data poisoning which can effectively transfer across different datasets and architectures. \n\nThe strengths of the paper lie in its novelty, clarity, comprehensive evaluation, and the fact that it provides implementation details. However, it is noted that some concern remains regarding the theoretical explanation and practicality of the method.\n\nLimitations include the exclusive use of the $\\ell_2$ norm, the potential requirement for a high poison rate to be effective, and concerns about the method's effectiveness in scenarios where data is sourced from multiple places. Theoretical connections between Lemma 3.1 and the effectiveness of the proposed method in poisoning attacks are deemed insufficient. There is also concern about the performance of the proposed method against adaptive attacks, as well as scenarios with a mix of poisoned and clean data.\n\nIn response to reviewers' rebuttals, the authors have provided satisfactory clarifications leading to score improvements by some. However, questions and suggestions for further work on optimisation hyperparameters and comparison with different forms of correlated noise remain.\n\nSummarizing the above, the manuscript is found to offer a potentially critical contribution to the field, albeit with some room for improvement and expansion. The final decision should take into account all reviewers' valuable feedback and suggestions."

        "generation": "As the meta-reviewer, my role is to synthesize the points made by all reviewers, summarize any conflicting opinions, and make a final recommendation. Here is my evaluation for the manuscript:\n\nStrengths:\n- The new preference model this paper introduces, based on the advantage function, provides a fresh angle to the problem of learning from human preferences, which is very innovative and insightful.\n- The theoretical groundwork set in the paper, particularly the results demonstrating identifiability in the proposed model, is a strong aspect of this work.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- The most profound weaknesses identified by the reviewers lie in the clarity and validity of the theoretical arguments set out in the paper. Specifically, the comparison between Theorems 3.1 and 3.2 appears to be a crucial point causing doubts among the reviewers.\n- The experimental validation of the proposed algorithm needs to be more robust. The experiments currently revolve around a toy grid world environment which might not provide a robust evaluation of algorithm performance.\n- The authors have not demonstrated a comparison with inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) methods. As the problem at hand is related to learning from human preferences, it would be essential to compare the proposed method against IRL methods.\n- Several areas of the paper are found to be lacking in detail, including explanations on the algorithm implementation, reward and policy inputs, and the experimental procedure. \n\nGiven the strength of the novelty and theoretical groundwork set out in this paper, and aligning with the points made by the reviewers, I see merit in this work. However, I urge the authors to take the criticisms into serious account. The authors must revisit the theoretical explanations, especially around Theorems 3.1 and 3.2, and provide clarifications. I also urge the authors to perform a more robust experimental validation of their algorithm that includes comparison with existing IRL methods. Detailed explanations of the experimental setup and the algorithm implementation should also be provided.\n\nAt this stage, my recommendation is that the work needs significant revisions. However, if these revisions are made and the authors adequately address the concerns mentioned, then I see potential in this manuscript for publication. The authors must also address the direct questions posed to them by the reviewers, such as the scalability issue, the assumptions of Theorems 3.1 and 3.2, and the approach in settings with multiple optimal policies."

        "generation": "The paper studied linear and ReLU regression problems in presence of Massart noise, which represents a more liberal adversarial alteration of the provided data. An efficient algorithm was proposed showing some interesting theoretical achievements including exact parameter recovery. It has also been acknowledged that the results are built upon previous contributions and approaches while tackling some of their limitations. Despite certain concerns being raised, they were addressed to an extent in the authors' response.\n\nReview 1 appreciated the paper's technical achievements, revealing a general positive outlook while pointing out certain ambiguities and improvements needed in the exposition. They expressed reservations regarding the robustness of the method in a realistic noise-inflicted setting. The author's response clarified the concerns but did not completely appease the reviewer's reservations on improving paper readability.\n\nReview 2 also appreciated the paper's expertise with its proposed algorithm, while stressing on acknowledging the influence of previous work in the paper. They were also interested in the main challenges of extending the results from linear regression to ReLU regression. The author's response seemed to adequately satisfy the reviewer's concerns although further improvements could be made in recognizing related work.\n\nReview 3 considered the paper well-written and organized, with a careful evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses. Minor issues were raised regarding the definitions and readability of the text yet overall were sufficiently appeased by the authors' response.\n\nReview 4 asked about the bit complexity of the parameters and computational cost of obtaining the radial-isotropic transformation matrix, the distributional assumption was queried as well. They suggested these concerns compromised the paper's novelty. The authors' response seemed to alleviate some but not all of these concerns.\n\nFinal sophisticated reading of the paper, the individual reviews and the authors' response to these reviews leads to a consensus that the paper delivers some interesting technical achievements and proposes an algorithm yielding promising results. However, the paper could gain from further clarifications, better organization of content and readability improvements. Its pertinence with previous work needs to be made clearer and details of the general mathematical model along with the computational cost involved merit more attention.\n\nTaking all into consideration, the paper holds enough value and novelty to warrant acceptance, given the authors address the concerns raised. Notably, improvements in the exposition, clarification of assumptions, and a detailed discussion on computational aspects should be undertaken."

        "generation": "This manuscript proposes gradient broadcast adaptation (GBA), a method intended to defend against backdoor attacks on pre-trained Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. The reviewers expressed mixed opinions on the paper. The strengths highlighted include its novelty, ease of application in a fine-tuning or prompt pipeline, and potential utility in defending against backdoor attacks on language models. The core idea of the proposed approach, which normalizes \"perturbed weights\" back to a normal state, was praised as simple and innovative.\n\nHowever, the reviewers also raised several valid criticisms. Notably, there were questions about the technique's effectiveness when applied to more complex tasks, as the adopted experimental frameworks mostly handle straightforward classification scenarios. There were also concerns about the statistical significance of the empirical results. The method was not found to outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in certain settings. Moreover, reviewers emphasized that the paper's writing quality needs substantial improvement, highlighting numerous instances of grammatical errors, repetition, and missing definitions. \n\nAdditionally, certain technical aspects of the proposed method raised questions among reviewers. For instance, there were queries on the applicability of the GBA method in scenarios involving tokens absent in the training data. As the method computes gradients per input sentence, it is unclear how updates would apply to these unseen tokens. \n\nDespite these criticisms, reviewers acknowledged the significance of the problem the paper tackles and praised the authors for exploring an under-researched area. It was suggested by one reviewer that the method could serve as a \"firewall\" in standard language model adaptation operations, eliminating the need to worry about potential performance degradation or computational inefficiency. However, this assessment also generated further suggestions for additional defenses yet to be tested.\n\nIn conclusion, while recognizing the potential impact of the work, the reviewers have unanimously recommended substantial revisions to the manuscript. The concerns include lacking experimental diversity, questionable statistical significance, under clarified technical details, and significant issues with the paper's writing style. Therefore, the manuscript in its current form should be revised significantly and resubmitted to address these critical points. The promising aspects of the proposed approach warrant a rescoring contingent upon these improvements."
