        "generation": "ation for Point Cloud Detection\" presents a novel approach to unsupervised domain adaptation for point cloud detection. The authors propose a domain-specific 3D encoder for domain-specific feature extraction, a shared Bird-Eye-View (BEV) transformation module to learn domain-agnostic BEV features, and an augmented contrastive alignment scheme to align the BEV feature distributions induced by pseudo-labels and the true distribution. The manuscript demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method on three large-scale datasets and achieves a new state-of-the-art.\n\nThe reviewers generally agree that the manuscript presents a valuable contribution to the field of point cloud detection and unsupervised domain adaptation. Reviewer 1 notes that the proposed method effectively closes the domain gaps and can outperform recent SOTA methods. Reviewer 2 finds the proposed method interesting and novel, but raises concerns about the pseudo-label generation and the potential negative societal impact of the work. Reviewer 3 suggests several improvements, including comparing the high-level 3D features with the BEV features, discussing the difference between the \"co-training\" in this paper and other related works, and providing more analysis on the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\nAfter synthesizing the feedback from the reviewers, it is clear that the manuscript has both strengths and weaknesses. The strengths include the novel approach to unsupervised domain adaptation for point cloud detection, the effectiveness of the proposed method on three large-scale datasets, and the potential to reduce the annotation efforts for point cloud detection tasks. The weaknesses include the potential negative societal impact of the work, the lack of comparison with other related works, and the need for further analysis on the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\nIn my opinion, the manuscript is well-written and presents valuable contributions to the field. However, I agree with Reviewer 2 that the pseudo-label generation process needs further analysis and discussion. Additionally, I suggest that the authors provide more comparisons with other related works to further demonstrate the novelty and effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\nIn conclusion, the meta-review suggests that the manuscript \"3D-CoCo: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Point Cloud Detection\" presents a valuable contribution to the field of point cloud detection and unsupervised domain adaptation. While the manuscript has both strengths and weaknesses,"

The approach relies on a scalable algorithm with adaptive randomization, a non-asymptotic upper bound on the type-I error for online updating, and a maximum number of data peeking times that grows with the number of observations. The manuscript also provides a bootstrap method for determining the stopping boundary and presents experiments on the finite sample performance of the test procedure with simulated and real data from Yahoo.\n\nThe reviewers generally acknowledge the manuscript's strengths, including its well-written and clear introduction, solid theoretical results, and experimental results. However, some reviewers raise concerns about the methodology, theoretical guarantees, and the clarity of the writing.\n\nOne reviewer questions the novelty and significance of the proposed approach, asking for a more specific case study to demonstrate its application in tech companies where ATE fails. Another reviewer finds the presentation of Section 3.2 unfriendly and suggests moving the theorems and derivations to the appendix.\n\nA third reviewer raises several questions about the assumptions and the algorithm, including the meaning of Equations (1), (6), and (7), and how the results compare to multi-armed bandit testing with online FDR control.\n\nOverall, the manuscript has both strengths and weaknesses. While it presents a promising approach to A/B testing and provides solid theoretical guarantees and experimental results, some concerns remain regarding the methodology and the clarity of the writing.\n\nTo improve the manuscript, the authors could consider addressing the following recommendations:\n\n\n\n1.

Offer suggestions for improvement for the manuscript.\n\n\n\nHere is a meta-review for the manuscript based on the above reviews and discussions:\n\nThe manuscript presents a novel approach to object pose estimation that addresses the challenge of low-textured objects. The proposed method, OnePose++, leverages the keypoint-free matching method LoFTR to improve the accuracy of pose estimation. The manuscript also introduces a new dataset, OnePose-HARD, which contains low-texture objects with pose annotations.\n\nThe reviewers generally agree that the proposed method improves the accuracy of pose estimation for low-textured objects. However, there are concerns about the novelty and significance of the proposed approach. Reviewer 3 questions the method's contribution to the field and suggests that it is not clear how the proposed method generalizes to unseen objects. Reviewer 1 suggests that the keypoint-free SfM approach is not a novel contribution and that the proposed method is an instance-level method, not a generalizable object pose estimation approach.\n\nThe reviewers also raise several minor concerns. Reviewer 2 suggests that the description of the proposed OnePose-HARD dataset is quite abstract and that example images of the new dataset are not included in the paper. Reviewer 1 suggests that the source of the results of other methods compared to the proposed method should be clarified.\n\nBased on the reviews and discussions, it is clear that the proposed method has potential in improving object pose estimation for low-textured objects. However, further research is needed to address the concerns raised by the reviewers, such as the novelty and significance of the proposed approach, the clarity of the description of the proposed dataset, and the runtime of the proposed method.\n\nTo improve the manuscript, the authors could provide more detailed descriptions of the keypoint-free SfM approach and its difference from prior work"

The authors also introduce a cost function to enable the generative model to generate images associated with a specific class label. The manuscript has received four reviews, which raise several major and minor points.\n\nMajor Points:\n\n1. Lack of clarity in the privacy guarantee: Reviewer 1 questions the privacy guarantee of the proposed method and suggests that the authors should provide a clear privacy proof.\n2. Originality: Reviewer 2 and 4 suggest that the proposed method lacks originality as it is a straightforward application of existing techniques from Wang et al. and Zhu et al.\n3. Robustness against hyperparameter choices: Reviewer 1 and 3 question the claim of robustness against hyperparameter choices and suggest that a theoretical or experimental analysis is necessary to support this claim.\n4. Performance: Reviewer 3 suggests that the proposed method performs poorly compared to GS-WGAN in terms of inception score and FID, and that the generated samples lack diversity.\n\nMinor Points:\n\n1. Definition of $\\hat{S}$: Reviewer 1 asks for a clarification of the definition of $\\hat{S}$.\n2. Concatenation of data and labels in the cost function: Reviewer 4 wonders if concatenating data and labels in the cost function is a good strategy, as the data and label spaces are very different.\n3. Relationship to Chen et al.: Reviewer 4 mentions that much of the gain relative to previous work comes from the way gradients are compressed, which appears already in the NeurIPS paper of Chen et al.\n4. Simplistic accuracy measures: Reviewer 4 suggests that the paper should consider more sophisticated accuracy measures, such as task-specific accuracy, and explore how well the framework can be adapted to such measures.\n\nSynthesis:\nThe manuscript has received mixed reviews, with some reviewers questioning the originality, privacy guarantee, and performance of the proposed method. While Reviewer 4 suggests that the paper achieves a moderate improvement over the work of Chen et al., Reviewer 3 suggests that the method performs poorly compared to G"

Its originality and theoretical contributions are significant, but there are concerns about the experimental results and presentation. To improve the manuscript, the authors could consider addressing the concerns raised by the reviewers, such as providing more details about their experimental setup and procedures, clarifying their assumptions and conclusions, and potentially conducting additional experiments to support their claims.\n\nOverall, the manuscript has the potential for publication, but it needs to be revised and improved in several areas to meet the standards of the journal. The authors should carefully consider the feedback from the reviewers and revise the manuscript accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The authors should address the weaknesses and minor comments to improve the clarity and impact of the manuscript."

        "generation": "method may be too simple to be effective. There are also some technical details that need to be clarified.\n\nThe reviewers have raised several concerns, including the need for more experiments to validate the proposed method using at least one more pre-trained language model, the lack of clarity in some technical details, and the need for more analysis on the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\nAfter considering all the comments, I give the current rating for this paper as 3.5 out of 5. The proposed method has both strengths and weaknesses, and the main concerns of the reviewers need to be addressed. The authors should consider conducting more experiments and providing more analysis to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.\n\n\n\nNote: The above meta-review is just an example, and the actual rating and feedback may vary depending on the specific comments and concerns of the reviewers."
