The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through two comprehensive case studies, showing how it can be used to draw robust conclusions about model performance and to identify interaction effects in the hyperparameter space.\n\nStrengths and weaknesses of the manuscript:\nThe reviewers identify several strengths of the manuscript, including its novel approach to multiverse analysis, its use of Gaussian process surrogates and Bayesian experimental design, and its ability to draw robust conclusions about model performance. However, they also identify several weaknesses, including the limited scope of the case studies, the lack of a quantitative analysis of the interaction effects, and the potential environmental impact of the computationally intensive approach.\n\nMain limitations and criticisms of the manuscript:\nThe reviewers identify several limitations and criticisms of the manuscript, including the limited scope of the case studies, the lack of a quantitative analysis of the interaction effects, and the potential environmental impact of the computationally intensive approach. They also suggest that the authors could consider using existing experiments results through efficient surrogate models to reduce the computation time.\n\nOverview of the manuscript's significance and potential impact on the field:\nThe reviewers suggest that the manuscript has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of machine learning by providing a principled and practical way to achieve reproducible results and draw robust conclusions. However, they also identify several challenges and limitations that need to be addressed in future work, including the need for a more comprehensive analysis of the interaction effects and the need to consider the environmental impact of the approach.\n\nFinal conclusion on the manuscript's overall quality and suitability for publication:\nBased on the reviews and discussions, it is recommended that the manuscript be published after addressing the identified limitations and criticisms. The manuscript's novel approach to multiverse analysis, its use of Gaussian process surrogates and Bayesian experimental design, and its ability to draw robust conclusions about model performance make it a valuable contribution to the field of machine learning.

        "generation": "\n\nMeta-Review\n\nThe manuscript \"Calibrating Bias-Only Models for Ensemble-Based Debiasing\" presents a novel approach to improving the performance of ensemble-based debiasing (EBD) methods by calibrating the bias-only models used in these methods. The authors provide theoretical analysis and empirical evidence to support their claims, and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on several NLP tasks. However, the reviews and discussions raise several concerns and criticisms that need to be addressed.\n\nStrengths and Weaknesses\n\nThe main strengths of the manuscript include its novel approach to improving EBD methods, its theoretical analysis and empirical evidence, and its clear and concise writing. However, the reviews and discussions identify several weaknesses, including the lack of novelty in the proposed approach, the inconsistent results on image datasets, and the need for more thorough experimental analysis.\n\nAreas of Agreement\n\nThe reviewers generally agree that the manuscript provides a valuable contribution to the field of EBD methods, and that the proposed approach has the potential to improve the performance of these methods. They also agree that the theoretical analysis and empirical evidence provided in the manuscript are well-motioned and well-supported.\n\nConcerns and Criticisms\n\nSeveral reviewers raise concerns about the novelty and impact of the proposed approach, suggesting that it may not be as groundbreaking as the authors claim. Others point out inconsistent results on image datasets, and suggest that the proposed approach may not be effective in all cases. Additionally, some reviewers suggest that more thorough experimental analysis is needed to fully evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n\nAddressing Concerns and Criticisms\n\nWhile the proposed approach may not be entirely new, the authors provide a clear and well-motived explanation of its theoretical basis and empirical effectiveness. The inconsistent results on image datasets may be due to the limitations of the datasets and models used, rather than the proposed approach itself. Further experimental analysis is needed to fully evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, but the existing evidence suggests that it has the potential to improve the performance of EBD methods.\n\nRecommendations for Improvement\n\nBased on the reviews and discussions, several areas of improvement could be identified, including:\n\n1. Providing more thorough experimental analysis"
