The paper is well-motivated and fairly well-written with some interesting theoretical achievements. However, the writing can be improved to make the contents more accessible to a general audience, and the transitions between topics need to be smoother. The paper lacks proper discussion at some points, and more concrete discussions on crucial algorithmic components are needed. \n\nThe manuscript makes a highly convincing case for its advancement impact and demonstrates a strong grasp of existing literature. The results are novel and significant, as the approach is generalized from linear to ReLU regressions, which is non-trivial. However, the Introduction section does not completely reflect the existing literature.\n\nThe soundness of the paper is also a concern. The adversary described in Definition 1.1 does not match with the one explained in the text, and there are concerns about the theoretical guarantee, sample complexity, and bit complexity dependence in running time. \n\nOverall, the paper is recommended for acceptance with a weak-accept vote at this stage, but improvements in clarity, soundness, and novelty are necessary to strengthen the overall submission."

The proposed inverse rendering pipeline and denoising step show significant advancement in the field, with the denoiser effectively reducing variance in Monte Carlo light integration at lower sampling rates. The idea to use denoisers in this manner is well motivated and implemented, making a strong case for the novelty of the manuscript.\n\nThe paper provides thorough evaluations of the method and performs a detailed ablation study, demonstrating its benefits. However, the focus on single bounce of light and lack of quantitative evaluation of individual attributes' reconstruction accuracy are noted limitations. Additionally, the training time is not as fast as expected, and the effect of the new regularizer is not tested in an ablation study.\n\nThe introduction of the work is clear, well written, and easy to follow, but could benefit from including a discussion on the challenges or design choices involved in creating such a system. The discussion on the bias introduced is unclear, although the limitations have been well addressed.\n\nThe paper is deemed better suited for computer vision or graphics venues than NeurIPS.
