                "A": "\n\nMeta-Review:\n\nThis paper extends Prior Networks models, previously introduced for classification, to regression problems. The authors propose a method for modelling uncertainty in regression tasks by emulating an ensemble using a single model. The proposed approach returns the parameters of a Normal-Wishart distribution, which defines a probability distribution over Normal distributions, and, in turn, each Normal distribution defines a probability distribution over the value of the target variable.\n\nThe reviewers generally find the paper well-written and clearly structured. However, they have concerns regarding the novelty of the proposed approach. One reviewer notes that the extension to regression tasks follows closely the work previously carried out for classification, with the only difference being the use of a Normal Wishart distribution instead of a Dirichlet distribution. Another reviewer comments that the paper lacks novelty as it builds heavily on previous work.\n\nThe reviewers also raise questions about the sensitivity of the training parameters and the lack of comparison with alternative methods to estimate prediction uncertainty. One reviewer suggests comparing the proposed method with Bayesian neural networks using variational inference or dropout.\n\nThe reviewers also have concerns regarding the experiments presented in the paper. One reviewer notes that the OOD loss term in the loss function (8) is a bit artificial, and the choice of beta is not systematic. Another reviewer suggests using a \"bad GAN\" to obtain synthetic inputs that are far from true inputs.\n\nOverall, the reviewers find the paper technically sound, but with limited novelty and concerns regarding the experiments presented. They suggest improvements to the paper, including comparing the proposed method with alternative methods and providing more clarity in the presentation of the experimental protocol."

The presented approach does not introduce any novel idea or insight, and its contribution is limited. However, it is well-written and clearly structured, and most design choices are justified. The idea is simple but works well, and the evaluation shows promising results. The method uses a Normal-Wishart distribution to define a probability distribution over Normal distributions, which in turn defines a probability distribution over the target variable. The paper is technically sound, but some mathematical details are missing, and the experiments are not very convincing. The proposed approach does not compare to other approaches for distillation of regression tasks, and the OOD dataset used for training needs to be discussed more. The paper is borderline, and its weaknesses, such as the OOD dataset used for training and the lack of comparisons in the evaluation, are concerns.

                "content": "Prior Networks are a recently developed class of models which yield interpretable measures of uncertainty and have been shown to outperform state-of-the-art ensemble approaches on a range of tasks. They can also be used to distill an ensemble of models via \\emph{Ensemble Distribution Distillation} (EnD2), such that its accuracy, calibration and uncertainty estimates are retained within a single model. However, Prior Networks have so far been developed only for classification tasks. This work extends Prior Networks and EnD2 to regression tasks by considering the Normal-Wishart distribution. The properties of Regression Prior Networks are demonstrated on synthetic data, selected UCI datasets and a monocular depth estimation task, where they yield performance competitive with ensemble approaches."

                "content": "This paper extends Prior networks models, previously introduced for classification, to regression problems.  Prior networks are neural networks whose main target is to \"modelling uncertainty in classification tasks by emulating an ensemble using a single model\".  Standard Prior networks models output the parameters of a Dirichlet probability distribution. This Dirichlet probability distribution then defines a distribution over categorical probability distributions over the different classes. This hierarchical approach allows to better capture uncertainty. The presented approach extends this framework to regression tasks. So, instead of returning the parameters of a Dirichlet distribution, it returns the parameters of a Normal-Wishart distribution, which then defines a probability distribution over Normal distributions, and, in turn, each Normal distribution defines a probability distribution over the value of the target variable.  \n\n\nPros:\n* The presented approach is sound and addresses a relevant problem, which is modelling uncertainty for regression problems. \n* A method for distilling an ensemble model into a single model while maintaining accuracy is also proposed. \n* The proposed approach does not incur in computational and memory overheads like standard deep ensembles. \n* This work properly approaches technical difficulties (such as employing numerical stable precision parametrizations of the Normal-Wishart distribution) that arise in this kind of problems.\n\nCons: \n* The presented approach does not introduce any novel idea or insight. It's a relatively simple extension of a previously published method. \n* The empirical results do not show a clear advantage of the presented approach wrt previously published proposals. \n* The advantage of having a small computational and memory overhead is not properly evaluated with other proposals which also have a small  computational and memory overhead [1] (although this proposal has not been defined for regression problems, the adaptation to regression is as simple as the adaptation of the DeepEnsembles models employed in this work). \n\n\nI can not recommend the acceptation of this paper because I find the originality of the work quite limited. Although the extension of prior networks to regression task is mot really straightforward because of technical issues related to the problem of learning the parameters of a Normal-Wishart distribution. The general strategy to do that exactly matches the previous steps employed when introducing prior networks.  In consequence, this work does not provide any new relevant insight into the problem of modelling uncertainty and learning models with well-calibrated predictions. \n\n\nMinor comments:\n- Eq (14): T parameter is not defined.

                "content": "Prior Networks (Malinin & Gales, 2018) use Dirichlet prior over categorical predictive distributions to distill ensembles for classification tasks. This paper extends Prior Networks to the regression setting by using a Normal-Wishart prior in order to attempt to match the predictive diversity. The authors define the model and loss terms including analytical derivation and evaluate their proposed approach with synthetic data, UCI datasets and monocular depth estimation. \n\n_Strengths_:\n- The paper is well-written and clearly structured.\n- Most design choices are justified.\n- Simple idea (in a good way!) which seemed to work well, shown by the evaluation.\n\n_Weaknesses_:\n- Most of the work seems to be heavily based on Prior Networks (Malinin & Gales, 2018). Even Section 2.1 seems to be exactly like the Subsection in the paper about Prior Networks. This paper mainly focuses on an extension to the regression task. Therefore, the contribution / novelty of this paper is incremental. However, I still think the authors did a good job to present a general distillation method for regression task. Therefore, I would consider the novelty a minor weakness.\n- I am on the fence about specifying the OOD dataset for learning with the loss in Eq. 8. I believe it is difficult to decide what kind of model to use for generating the OOD dataset, thus, the model choice can lead to large differences in performance. This is not really discussed. Further, the models trained have more data available for training, I believe it is not quite fair to compare against models which only have been trained on in-domain-data.\n- There are no comparisons to other approaches for distillation of regression tasks. I understand, that this paper wants to show a viable general approach for regression distillation, however, this work is not the first one to do so and therefore should consider existing work.\n\n_Overall assessment_: For me, this paper is borderline. The weaknesses, especially the OOD dataset used for training and the lack of comparisons in the evaluation are concerns. However, I like the idea and the execution so therefore, I would recommend a weak accept (6).\n\n_Detailed comments and questions_:\n- OOD data: I have seen that you have an ablation for the degree of regularization on the OOD dataset. However, what about different OOD data? Why choose KITTY and not a different dataset? Were there any large difference in performance?\n- Table 3: I notice that NLL performance of distilled models are better than the actual ensemble, how can this be?\n- OOD detection for monocular depth estimation: Did you also trained the comparing models with the OOD data, e.g. DD?\n- Comparing models: Have you consider comparing your model to other ones, e.g. [1, 2]? This could improve your paper and approach to show that it also consider existing work on regression distillation.\n\n_Post-rebuttal_:\nI really appreciate the authors adding baseline models to the paper and missing citations. I do think this improves the overall paper by a lot. As mentioned already in my paper, I do believe this is a nice idea and executed well, even though novelty might be limited.

High beta makes the bound tight and the training to be more accurate.

                "content": "We are very happy to provide a discussion of various alternative approaches to making ensembles computationally cheaper. Indeed, we\u2019ve found 2 papers on a similar approach to distilling an ensemble into a single model [1,2] by having multiple output heads, where each head is meant to replicate the behaviour of a particular ensemble member. We believe that this is as close a baseline as we can make - it is almost identical in compute to EnD^2, it's also a distillation approach, and it also attempts to preserve ensemble diversity. We have provided these results  in TABLE 3 and TABLE 4 of the updated manuscript. Generally, this works a little better for predictive quality than EnD^2, and worse for OOD detection. Results on Kitti for MDD are not ready yet, but are being calculated.  Do you find these results sufficient? \n\nRegarding BatchEnsembles - we\u2019ve had a closer look, and we currently don\u2019t actually understand how it is cheaper *at run time*. While it is true that a BatchEnsemble model has about as many parameters as a single model *on disk*, at *run time* it trades of increased use of GPU memory (batch is replicated) for efficient use of said GPU. Thus, it may be faster than sequential evaluation of an explicit ensemble, but it certainty is not more memory efficient at run time. We will certainly cite, mention and discuss this range of works. However, implementing it is non-trivial -the libraries you\u2019ve sent us are in Tensorflow, not Pytorch, so we cannot directly carry them over. \n\nIf you insist, we CAN promise to implement BatchEnsembles and add this into the camera ready paper (if this paper is accepted). We would definitely keep this promise, as it would be quite embarrassing to make it publicly and then break it.  \n\n[1] HYDRA: PRESERVING ENSEMBLE DIVERSITY FOR MODEL DISTILLATION (Tran et al).\n[2] Ensemble Approaches for Uncertainty in Spoken Language Assessment, Wu et al, 2020, Interspeech.\n"

                "content": "We initially tried to add table here, but unfortunately it turns out that the system ignores formatting and just dumps numbers. Results are presented in TABLE 3 and TABLE 4 of updated manuscript. \n\nFor all versions of DER (2019 ArXiv and 2020 Neurips) we used a weight of 0.1 on the evidence regulariser. For DER 2020 we checked the implementation of the student NLL against the pytorch version and made sure that everything is correctly parameterised.\n\nThe results show a few things. \n\nFirstly, the old version of DER (ArXiv 2019) doesn't work well, both in terms of predictive performance, and in terms of uncertainty estimation. Which expected, due to the error on the loss.  \n\nSecondly, the new version of DER (NeurIPS 2020 preproceedings) works much better. In terms of predictive performance it is comparable to a single probabilistic DenseDepth model , though still with a minor degradation. In terms of OOD detection performance of models trained on NYU- it  yields rather competitive performance, marginally worse than the ensemble, and outperformed by EnD^2.\n\nThirdly, on KITTI OOD detection the LSUN OOD data is OOD not only because it is indoors, but also because it represents images which are very close to the camera, relative to images seen in Kitti, which features a range of depths. Here, all models, except RPN + RKL, interpret the OOD data as being in-domain using measures of total uncertainty. Using measures of ensemble diversity (knowledge uncertainty), ensembles, RPN-RKL and EnD^2 are able to detect OOD images successfully. Notably, DER does not seem to be able to. The reason for this is that the evidence regulariser biases the DER model tol yield high evidence in regions of low absolute error, and low evidence in regions of high absolute error. As a result, regions which are closer (bottom half of kitty images) always have higher evidence. As LSUN OOD is very close to the camera, the DER model yields high evidence. \n"

                "content": "Thanks for your comment! \n\nRegarding Evidential Deep Learning, particularly [2] - we think it is a rather elegant alternative interpretation for uncertainty estimation, rooted in Dempster-Schafer Theory of evidence, which yields a model which is structurally identical to a Dirichlet Prior Network. However, we are sceptical of the principal claim that this is a reliable single-model uncertainty estimation approach which doesn\u2019t require OOD data or indeed any other approach to enforcing a particular behaviour for OOD inputs which has an understandable mechanism of action. However, that is only our opinion - a rigorous large-scale validation is necessary and clearly would be a useful future direction of investigation. \n\nRegarding your paper (congrats on getting into NeurIPS!). We see our work as being very much an extension and verification of the ideas proposed in [3]. We became aware of your work around the same time as we began ours, however, to the best of our knowledge (until your comment) it was a submission at ICLR2020. Furthermore, upon examination at the time, we determined that the loss function (expectation of square error given samples from the Normal-inverse-Gamma) had an error in the derivation (equations 7-9, derivation 7.1.2 eq. 22-23 in the appendix). As a result, we had no grounds on which to believe in the validity of the results. Looking at the ArXiv submission now - it has not been updated within the last year and still contains the error . \n\nWith respect to the experimental setup - while we both use UCI (which is standard) and NYU Depth v2, our evaluations are quite different. We have used a standard architecture, provided detailed performance comparisons to baselines in depth estimation [4,6], and analysed the properties of several uncertainty measures via ROC-AUC against a range of OOD datasets.\n\nHowever, we have now found your new NeurIPS2020 version in the pre-proceedings (which were released after the ICLR2021 submission deadline), and we see that the mathematical error has now been fixed. In fact, an altogether different loss function (NLL of the student distribution) is used in addition to the evidence regularizer. The results are largely the same. \n\nWe\u2019ve implemented DER both as it is on ArXiv and as it is in the NeurIPS2020 pre-proceedings, and present the results in the next post. Unfortunately, a direct number-for-number comparison to your work is not possible, as there are no summary performance results for your model, and figure 4B contains a range for RMSE which is about 20 times smaller than what is reported in the depth estimation literature [4,6] (you\u2019ve probably scaled something differently). Furthermore, you use a different OOD dataset which seems to be very easy to separate out, as all models achieve a ROC-AUC of about 0.99. \n\nWe will add these results to our paper (omitting the old DER), and cite your work (and the original Evidential work), in our paper. We shall upload an updated version shortly. \n\n\n[1] Amini, Alexander, et al. \"Deep evidential regression.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2020.\n[2] Sensoy, Murat, et al. \"Evidential deep learning to quantify classification uncertainty.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2018.\n[3] Uncertainty Estimation in Deep Learning with Application to Spoken Language Assessment, Malinin, 2019.

                "content": "Thank you for reply! \n\nI agree deep ensembles can be considered as an upper bound. My point is that there are alternative methods like BatchEnsembles, Rank-1 BNNs, SNGP, etc. (this repo https://github.com/google/uncertainty-baselines contains the references and high-quality open source implementations of all of them) which could be easily adapted for regression and which have much lower time and memory complexity than ensemble methods. In my opinion,  at least one of them should be considered here as relevant baseline, because  only comparing wrt deep ensembles gives the impression that your method is the only available alternative that provides  a big reduction in time and memory complexity  wrt deep ensembles. I think it is fair to show (or at least discuss) that there are other approaches that can be employed here to strongly reduce the memory and time complexity of deep ensembles. \n\nThe lack of novelty of this paper, as acknowledged by other reviewers, puts much more pressure in the empirical evaluation. As I said before, there are well-established prior works which directly address the high memory and time complexity of deep ensembles that can be easily adapted to regression and which, in my opinion, should be considered by this work.

In line with many of the reviewer comments regarding novelty, I was also wondering about the relation of the proposed contribution to published evidential deep learning (EDL) approaches [1,2]. Namely, published at NeurIPS this year, Deep Evidential Regression [1] also proposes learning a 1D Normal-Wishart distribution directly to infer representations of uncertainty specifically in the continuous regression domain as well (not classification). The proposed contribution presented here, like [1], also provides experimental results on nearly identical tasks from UCI and on monocular depth estimation. Also, note that deep evidential networks are structurally identical to prior networks (PN), with the only differences being in their respective objective functions (PN additionally require OOD data to train with, EDL does not). Given that a preprint of [1] appeared over a year ago and is now peer-reviewed/published, as well as the foundational work done in the classification domain [2] is over two years old now, I think it would be very helpful for the authors to cite these papers and and discuss their contributions relative to these works. \n\nI also hope this will help orient reviewers to the context for this submission and perhaps to some contributions that may have been missed. \n\n[1] Amini, Alexander, et al. \"Deep evidential regression.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2020.\n\n[2] Sensoy, Murat, et al. \"Evidential deep learning to quantify classification uncertainty.\" Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems. 2018."

We will make this clear. \n  B. I'm afraid that this isn't the case. The OOD loss doesn't regularise the choice of beta. Rather the OOD loss is supposed to inform the model of regions beyond which it has no understanding of the data. Clearly, this requires one to decide on and choose an OOD dataset, which is non-trivial. \nC. p(y | mu, Lambda) represents a Normal distribution sampled from the Normal-Wishart. \n\nSEC 2.3 - Yes, this is what I mean - the dataset can be seen an empirical distribution to which we minimise KL, or equivalently, maximise likelihood. Phi represents the parameters of the model into which we are distribution-distilling the ensemble. \n\nSEC 3.  ENSM is the Deep Ensemble. Respectfully, the behaviour of the estimates of data uncertainty out of domain is not relevant - data uncertainty is only important in-domain. Indeed, we cannot give any guarantees on the behaviour of data uncertainty in the OOD region. What we actually care about is that estimates of *knowledge uncertainty* increase as we move further out of domain, which is the case (though perhaps not so easy to see from the picture). We will update the picture to make this clearer.\n\nSEC 4   \nA. We will make the experimental protocol clearer in this section. We will add the description of the Prediction Rejection Ratio in the appendix. It shows what part of the best possible error-detection performance our algorithm covers. \n\nB. UCI datasets are very common datasets for evaluation in related works, that\u2019s why we decided to add them despite their simplicity.\n\nC. To obtain train-OOD-data for RKL, we used factor analysis with increased noise and latent variance. This is a simple generative model. We trained it on in-domain data and added noise to the latent variables to generate out-of-domain examples for RKL. This generative model is simple and appropriate for table data, while GANs are not usual for table data. Also, UCI datasets have few examples and small feature spaces, therefore it could be hard to train GANs on them.\n\nD. For the evaluation of OOD-detection performance, we took parts of other UCI datasets as OOD data. We made sure that the OOD-data comes from different domains and feature distributions are different. We felt that this was the best we could, as, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no established research on OOD detection for tabular datasets.\n\nSEC 5\n\nPerformance metrics in table 3 are usual for Monocular Depth Estimation. They describe model performance from different sides and are usually shown in all papers on this topic. A good description of these metrics can be found in the original Monocular Depth Estimation paper \u201cDepth Map Prediction from a Single Image using a Multi-Scale Deep Network\u201d by Eigen et al., in section 4.3. \n\nDelta 1,2,3 shows a percent of predictions such that the maximum of two fractions: (a) between predictions and targets, (b) between targets and predictions is less than corresponding thresholds: 1.25, 1.25^2, and 1.25^3. Rel stands for absolute relative error and log10 for RMSE between logarithms of predictions and targets. These losses show different properties of the model: deltas help to understand confidence intervals of the model, Rel shows the ratio between prediction error and target, and log10 shows error in the log-space. \n\nWe will add the definition of these metrics to the text and  attempt to simplify table 3 as much as possible.\n\nWe fully understand where you are coming from regarding table 4 and figure 3. We will rewrite this section and make it more understandable, it was hard to fit everything into a given space.\n\nRegarding Table 4 and the behaviour of the NWPN (RPN+RKL) model - we hypothesise this is the result of the interaction between the in-domain and OOD training data. It was very hard to get the models to appropriately train. Likely because discrimination between ID/OOD is a very global task (global scene understanding), while depth estimation requires more local data. The tasks are therefore anti-correlated in training. In contrast, EnD$^2$ doesn't suffer from the same problems and only relies on ID training data.\n\nThus, what we aim to show is that: 1) EnD$^2$ can appropriately replicate and surpass the ensemble's OOD performance. 2) NWPN (RPN+RKL) can sometimes do near-perfect OOD detection, but isn't as reliable in this particular task with this choice of OOD data. \n\n\nIn Figure 3 the left image is from KITTI and the right image is from NYU datasets. Using these images we aim to show that error of a prediction correlates with increased uncertainty of the model. Additionally, we wanted to show how the uncertainties of the ensemble and EnD$^2$ model compare, and we can see that the EnD$^2$ model consistently yields higher uncertainties, as it over-estimates the support of the ensemble.\n\n"

Regarding alternative Bayesian baselines:\n\nThe approach we use to generate ensembles  - Deep Ensembles [4], are already the current go-to SOTA Bayesian approach to uncertainty estimation [1,2,3]. Approaches like Dropout, while also capable of generating ensemble, are shown to be consistently inferior. Variational Inference is typically even worse and has never been successfully scaled to complex tasks such as Depth Estimation, to our knowledge.\n\nOur favoured proposed approach - Ensemble Distribution Distillation for regression, allows us to take a SOTA DeepEnsemble (which is the baseline relative to which we compare) and distill it into a single model, generally preserving most of the ensemble\u2019s gains. This allows us to replicate both the ensemble\u2019s predictive performance as well as uncertainty measures at the computational and memory cost of a single model. Thus, suffer a minor reduction in predictive quality (and no loss in the quality of uncertainty estimates) for an M-fold (where M is the ensemble size) reduction in computational and memory cost relative to the ensemble baseline. \n\n       [1] Can you trust your model\u2019s uncertainty?

Regarding empirical results:\n\n Could you please elaborate what you would see as a clear advantage? In terms of inference-time compute and memory the M-fold (where M is the ensemble size) advantage over Ensembles is clear. In terms of predictive performance - we outperform single models, and get close to the ensemble. Replicating the ensemble\u2019s predictive performance completely is an upper bound. In terms of OOD Ensemble-Distribution Distilled  RPNs outperform the ensemble. If there some specific comparison you would like us to provide which would convince you?\n\n2. Regarding BatchEnsemble:\n\nBatchEnsembles are interesting, however an efficient implementation of BatchEnsembles is non-trivial and there is no available code in pytorch (The original work was done in Edward). A naive implementation would be as expensive during inference as DeepEnsembles, if not more so, as it may require a larger ensemble to reach the same performance.

We agree with your concerns regarding the choice of OOD dataset. Defining an appropriate one for classification tasks is already non-trivial - doing so is even more challenging for regression. This is why we place greater emphasis on Ensemble Distribution Distillation - it does not require an OOD dataset and yields superior predictive performance relative to RKL-trained Regression Prior Networks.  \n\nWe will use the extra page to present a discussion regarding difficulties of using an OOD dataset, and will shortly upload an updated manuscript. \n\n2. With regards to regression distillation, we would like to point out that previous work has examined the distillation of a *single model  into a single model*. In our work we consider distillation of *an ensemble of probabilistic models into a single probabilistic model*. Limited prior work has examined this scenario, and it is difficult to provide a sensible baseline . We have attempted to do so through Ensemble Distillation (EnD), though it seems this approach also has its limitations. \n\nIt is, in general, not entirely clear whether combining an ensemble of probabilistic models is better done as an arithmetic or geometric mixture. A full analysis of ensembles of probabilistic regression models deserves an investigation of its own. Furthermore, to our knowledge, probabilistic ensemble distillation for regression has been a generally under-explored area. If you could point us to a more appropriate baseline, we would be happy to consider it!\n \t\nWe will add a detailed discussion of this issue into section 2.3 and upload an updated manuscript shortly. \n\nREGARDING DETAILED COMMENTS\n\n1 We were limited in the compute we had available for this project and decided to focus on the ablation study we did, rather than swapping out OOD datasets. In general, for Depth Estimation, we would like to place greater emphasis on RPNs trained through EnD$^2$, rather than RPNs trained via RKL on OOD datasets.\n\nIndeed, one of the conceptual reasons for not further exploring choice of OOD datasets for RPN+RKL is that we believe (and show) that RPNs+EnD$^2$ to be the superior approach. \n\nWe will clarify this point in an updated manuscript we will shortly upload. \n\n2. We believe this is a result of the fact that the EnD$^2$ will overestimate the support of the ensemble (as a natural consequence of ML training). As a result, it will be less over-confident. \n\n3. We didn\u2019t. To be clear - we intended our main comparison for Depth Estimation to be Ensembles vs  EnD$^2$ . Note that RPNs trained via RKL on OOD data in section 5 suffer degraded predictive performance. On the other hand, RPNs trained via  EnD$^2$ show better predictive performance (relative to EnD, Single models and RPN+RKL). \n\n4. : Thank you for pointing out this work. However, as previously stated, these papers consider the distillation of single model into single model, and thus cannot be used as a meaningful baselines. However we will cite them when discussing the nature of regression distillation and highlighting how our work is different.  \n\n"

                "content": "Dear Reviewers,\n\nAll of you have expressed concerns regarding the novelty and originality of our work. We would like to address this issue and explain why we think this merits a paper. \n\nIn our interactions with other researchers, and especially with industrial ML practitioners, we noticed that many people thought that the correct extension of Prior Networks to regression tasks would be to take a non-probabilistic regression model and place a Normal distribution over the target variable. As is clear from our work, this is not correct. Thus, one of the main motivations for this paper was to address this common misunderstanding and show that the correct way to extend Prior Networks and Ensemble Distribution Distillation to regression tasks.\n\nIn order to convey our message as clearly as possible we explicitly structured the paper around the parallel between Dirichlet and Normal-Wishart Prior Networks to make it absolutely self-evident what the correct approach is. In this regard we seem to have succeeded a little too well, as all of you note how the extension is straightforward and incremental. We would respectfully ask you to consider that this extension is not as evident to the majority of the ML community as we make it seem in this work. Notably, since the publication of the original paper on Dirichlet Prior Networks (Malinin and Gales, 2018), to our knowledge, Prior Networks have not been extended to regression, despite the popularity of the approach for classification. Thus, the value of our work is in extending a powerful uncertainty estimation approach for classification to regression, resolving a common misconception, and clearly presenting the mathematical basis for this extension. \n\nWe address your remaining concerns on a point-by-point basis and will shortly upload an updated manuscript.\n\nSincerely,\nAuthors\n"

                "content": "Summary of the Paper:\n\n        This paper introduces regression prior networks. These are models that aim at capture predictive uncertainty, both epistemic and aleatoric, in the context of regression problems. Regression prior networks can also be used to compress an ensemble of predictors into a single model while keeping the benefits of the ensemble. That is, better predictive performance and uncertainty estimates. The method is validated on several problems from the UCI repository and compared with ensemble methods.\n\nSpecific details:\n\n        I believe that this is a nice paper that illustrates an appealing method for uncertainty estimation in the context of neural networks. My main concern, however, is that it builds heavily on previous work. In particular, prior networks have already been proposed for classification and they have also been used to distill (compress) an ensemble. There is hence not much novelty here, only the extension to regression problems since, previously, only classification problems have been addressed. The use of prior networks for ensemble distillation is also not new. All this questions the novelty of the proposed approach.\n\n        The extension to regression seems to follow very closely the work already carried out for classification. The only difference is that a Normal Wishart distribution is used instead of a Dirichlet distribution.\n\n        The experiments carried out are extensive and consider different tasks involving prediction accuracy and out of distribution data detection. My main concern, however, is that no comparison is carried out with alternative methods to estimate prediction uncertainty such as those of Bayesian neural networks using variational inference or dropout. The authors should comment on the advantages of their method with respect to these techniques.\n\n        The method proposed is also complicated and has several training parameters. The authors give specific values for them, but it is not clear the motivation for them or the sensitivity to their values.\n\n        The paper is clearly written but heavily relies on previous work, making the reading difficult for someone who is not familiar with it. The paper is not self-contained.\n\n        Summing up I believe that this could be an interesting contribution for the conference, suffering from a reduced amount of novelty."

                "content": "This paper addresses interpretable uncertainty quantification for data driven models. In particular, the authors focus on a sub-class of methods known as Prior Networks and attempt to extend these methods to regression tasks as existing approaches address classification only. The author contribution is thus clearly stated and positioned w.r.t. prior arts and tackle a non-trivial issue.\n\nIn the classification setting, the Dirichlet distribution is pretty much the universal model for the parameters of multinomial distributions. For regression, i.e. continuous r.v., there is no such universal solution and the authors chose to focus on outputs that have a normal distribution. The parameters of this latter are assumed to be normal-Wishart. Although, the proposed method is de facto non-applicable to other types of distributions, it can be argued that this already covers a majority of situations. \n\nThe paper is rather well organized and seems technically sound. This said, a few mathematical details are missing and, most importantly, the experiments are not very convincing. These concerns, also with other minor remarks are detailed below, section by section.\n\nsec 2.2\n\nMaybe give the explicit definition of Z to clarify that is does not depend on network parameters.\nThe presence of the OOD loss term in (8) is a bit artificial as it boils down to regularizing because of the choice of beta. Is this choice systematic ?\nIn (9), how is p(y | mu, Lambda) computed ? Is it a T distribution ?\n\n2.3\n\n(12) lacks clarity : dataset is equal to an empirical distribution... Do you mean p hat is a sum of Dirac ?\nWhat does phi represent ?\n\n3\nThe acronym ENSM is not explained. I believe this corresponds to the deep ensemble. \nThe Prior Networks achieve a form of disambiguation but the quality of it is a bit disappointing compared to ENSM. In particular, data uncertainty raises quickly for out-of-domain inputs. \n\n4\n\nThe presentation of the experimental protocol in 4 lacks clarity thereby impairing the interpretation of the results. The definition of the unconventional performance criteria [(Malinin et al. 2020] must be recalled (at least in an appendix). \nIn addition, as honestly mentioned by the authors, these datasets may not offer sufficiently rich problems to provide interesting comparisons. Besides, the way that OOD data is generated does not seem to necessarily produce inputs that are not covered by the in-domain distribution. Perhaps, the authors could use a \"bad GAN\" to obtain such data points, I mean a GAN where the generator and the discriminator would co-operate instead of being adversaries. If it converges, the generator would produce synthetic inputs that are easy to discriminate, thus far from true inputs. \n\n5\nWhile the dataset used in this section is more challenging, the experiment description is confusing. Again, performance criteria are not sufficiently explained and the general message becomes cryptic. Table 3 is overly complicated, I think RMSE is fairly enough to depict regression performances. Moreover, the definition of some columns are missing.\nIn Table 4, the performances of the methods seem quite unstable. For example, NWPN works fairly well for a given dataset configuration for one knowledge uncertainty criterion but fails miserably using another criterion on the same data.\nOn Fig 3, from what dataset are these image coming from ? Why are these or that object presumably \"unknown\" to the model ?\nI think the whole section deserves some re-writing.\n\nFinal remark : there are a few English mistakes that should be wiped out. \n\n"

The proposed method is based on adapting a pre-trained WaveNet model to the new speaker's voice, and the authors evaluate the effectiveness of their approach using several objective and subjective measures.\n\nThe reviewers generally agree that the paper is well-written and the results are strong, indicating high quality, naturalness, and similarity with real speech from a speaker. However, there are some concerns and suggestions for improvement.\n\nReviewer 1 suggests that the paper should provide more details about the experimental setup, such as the type of linguistic features used and how they are acquired. The reviewer also mentions that the speaker-dependent linguistic features are not speaker-adapted, which may limit the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\nReviewer 2 suggests that the paper should provide more details about the early termination criterion used in the training process. The reviewer also suggests that the MOS evaluations should be done by a more diverse group of people to make the results more representative.\n\nReviewer 3 suggests that the paper should provide more details about the speaker verification model used in the evaluation.

Instead, the aim is to produce a network that requires few data at deployment time to rapidly adapt to new speakers. We introduce and benchmark three strategies:\n      (i) learning the speaker embedding while keeping the WaveNet core fixed,\n      (ii) fine-tuning the entire architecture with stochastic gradient descent, and\n      (iii) predicting the speaker embedding with a trained neural network encoder.\n      The experiments show that these approaches are successful at adapting the multi-speaker neural network to new speakers, obtaining state-of-the-art results in both sample naturalness and voice similarity with merely a few minutes of audio data from new speakers."

(2018) at a high level. However, this is a situation where the details seem to matter significantly. For instance, we find that the detail of applying few-shot adaptation to the WaveNet core results in better sample quality. \n\nWe have submitted a revision incorporating all reviewers\u2019 comments. Please see our response to your other questions below and let us know if any explanation is unclear.\n\n1) Details for acquiring linguistic features:\nWe did not provide a fine-grained explanation of the linguistic features originally because we used the same pipeline as van den Oord et al., (2016). We have now added a new section in the supplementary material of the revised paper (Section A) to explain how to extract the linguistic features and fundamental frequency at training and adaptation phases, and how to predict both at the inference phase.\n\n2) Speaker-dependent linguistic features\nThe linguistic features and F0 are provided as inputs during training, but are not available at inference time. Our experimental evaluation shows that even though the linguistic features are predicted by a standard speaker model, the voice similarity is high. This is because the speaker identity is closely dependent to the vocal tract properties, which are modelled by WaveNet. Nevertheless, we strongly agree that the linguistic features also contribute to the speaker identity in terms of prosody, accent, and so on. For this reason, we are considering future work on using our few-shot method for adapting F0 and linguistic features in the hope of improving performance.\n\n3) Superfluous naming\nYou raise a valid point. We however felt that those names captured the difference between the two approaches clearly, and fitted well with the overall presentation. If you think they reduce readability, please let us know and we\u2019ll consider alternatives.\n\n4) Method abbreviations without explanation\nSEA stands for our \u201csample efficient adaptive\u201d method as in the title. We have clarified this in the revision.\n\n5) Early stopping criterion\nThe early stopping criterion uses the validation loss on the hold-out data. \n\n6) Not comparable MOS in Table 1.\nYou\u2019re absolutely right. As discussed in Section 5.2, comparing all other methods in the exact same setting is challenging as it would require that we retrain all models on the same dataset with hyper-parameter sweeps. We did our best to make the setups as close as possible when reporting our MOS results and results from other references. Please note that the same five-point Likert Scale is shared by all evaluations, and the group of human raters is shared with Jia et al. (2018).\n\n7) Nachmani et al. (2018) and Arik et al. (2018) have also used speaker verification model as an objective evaluation.\nThis is true indeed. We even considered using this to compare approaches. However, any comparison with a speaker verification model is highly dependent on the model architecture, the training set, and the set of test speakers (both the identity and the size of the test set). For this reason, we decided to not include a naive comparison, even though we did find that we get the lowest equal error rate with SEA-ALL.\n"

On the one hand, SPSS+WaveNet obtains a natural decomposition of prosody (pace, intonation, etc) and vocal tract properties (more relevant to speaker identity) of a voice, something that is still difficult to do with seq2seq [1].

The work is extremely significant in that speech data is hard to produce  (we need many hours of speaker data), and techniques to adapt (transfer learning?) data from large networks would be quite valuable. The main idea is that we train a network containing a large amount of data, and (assuming that we have a trained model), we adapt this network to the task of generating speech from text for a much smaller dataset. \n\nIn general (insofar as we can use that term), one trains such a network using <text/speech> pairs,  with speaker conditioning as added input so as to produce voice from a given speaker. The input text is converted to linguistic features in the \u2018front end\u2019, which is then injected with voice features to be synthesized into a voice output in the backend. More recent efforts in speech modeling have used RNN or wavenet based systems to carry out these transformations in the front/backends. The present work seems to use an SPSS technique (Zen et al 2016) to generate the linguistic features, while the task of converting to voice is carried out by a Wavenet. \n\nThe work is quite (conceptually) similar to \"Neural voice cloning with a few samples\" (Arik et al, https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06006) in proposing techniques for few shot adaptation described below but with the significant difference that the latter used autoregressive DNNs (loosely speaking, seq2seq a la Tacotron) for the task in both the front and back ends, while in the current work, the linguistic features are computed with SPSS as in Zel et al (2016).\n\nThe paper proposes three quite related techniques for adaptation as shown clearly in Figure 2 of the paper. These techniques are again \u2018roughly\u2019 analogous to those described in the Baidu work \u201cNeural Voice Cloning with a few samples\u201d, with the difference in front and backend setups noted in the previous paragraph.\n\nWe take as text as input, and convert them to a representation for linguistic features as described in Zen et al (2016). To this, we now add the fundamental frequency F_0 for the sample voice. The key piece needed is the speaker embeddings (a vector), which is to be obtained by training. In addition to all this, we also have available the weights of a trained wavenet network (probably quite large) trained on many speakers, which we will modify (or not) using the strategies outlined for the few data dataset.\n\nSEA-EMB - Train embeddings, but not the network. We expect this to be \u2018fast\u2019, but not particularly accurate. \nSEA-ALL - Train embeddings, and network. This would be a much more accurate, if slower task. The authors note that since we train a very large network in this case, it could be prone to overfitting. They employ early stopping (as a practitioner, I would make note of the issue) with 10 % of the dataset being held out. Additional ideas such as initializing the emeddings - possibly with those that SEA-EMB calculates - are also stated to be useful.\nSEA-ENC - In this third version, they predict speaker embeddings from the trained larger network (the recipe is provided in the appendix). This task of predicting speaker embeddings is one of training a classifier.\n\n\nResults\nThe paper presents evaluations conducted with subjective, MOS based enrolment and with an evaluation metric from TI-SV d-vectors. Comparisons are made for all three models with human evaluated MOS scores, and it is seen that SEA-ALL outperforms the other two models, while performance in SEA-EMB depends on the amount of data used. Nevertheless, humans are still able to detect the difference between synthetic voices and real samples. \n\nThe TI-SV evaluations from Wan et al show t-SNE embeddings of \u2018clusters\u2019 of d-vectors for human and synthetic voices, where it is seen that inter-cluster distance (i.e. between different speakers) is high, showing that the model is able to discern speakers, and the intra-cluster distance (i.e. between real and synthetic voices) is low, showing that synthetic voices are \u2018similar\u2019 to real voices. In addition, three other measures - cosine similarity, and statistical measures for detection error trade off, ROC curves and cosine similarity measures are also presented, which show that that the adaptation models perform quite well. \n\n\nClarifications and comments:\n\nHave there been efforts to compare this model (with the SPSS based frontend) with seq2seq (Bahdanau/transformer) DNN based systems as in \u201cNeural Voice cloning with few samples\u201d?. How do they compare (is it even a valid comparison?)?\n\nI think the model for computing linguistic features could be elaborated upon further. \n\nRepresentations: I assume that the output audio representation is an audio waveform\n\nTypo 1 (minor): The reference  for \u201cBornschein et al\u201d in section 4 \u201cRelated work\u201d\n\u201cVariable inference for memory addressing\u201d. \nCorrection \u201cVariational memory addressing in generative models\u201d\n\nTypo 2 (minor): Figure 6: Lower curve indicate that the verification system is having a harder time distinguishing real from generated samples. \nCorrection (minor): Lower curve \u201cindicates\u201d ...\n\nSummary\n-------------\nIn summary, I am in favor of accepting this paper as it proposes a solution to adapt a trained network to one with has limited number of samples. A big issue in speech modeling is that datasets are tiny, and it is difficult to obtain good quality data at reasonable cost. It would be extremely useful to have a trained network that we can adapt for our own experiments. The related paper by Arik et al (Neural Voice cloning with a few samples) also operates with similar strategic aims, but uses a a different methodology using attention based DNNs. The paper under review should be a good addition to the toolbox of few shot adaptation/transfer learning for speech with much potential for practical use. "

The three approaches in this paper are almost the same as the voice cloning work in Arik et al. (2018). However, it is still very beneficial to demonstrate these approaches for linguistic feature conditioned WaveNet.\n\nDetailed comments:\n\n1) This manuscript is not self-contained, as it omits the important details for acquiring linguistic features (e.g., phoneme duration model) and fundamental frequency (F0) at training and test time. The only information is that it uses existing model (Zen et al., 2016) to predict linguistic features and F0. What type of linguistic features are used in this work? Is the existing model (Zen et al., 2016) trained on the same training set as WaveNet model?\n\n2) It seems the only speaker-dependent part of the system is the embedding table for WaveNet. Actually, both linguistic features (e.g., phoneme duration) and fundamental frequency sequence are highly speaker-dependent. The authors normalize F0 to make it as speaker-independent as possible. What about the speaker-dependent linguistic features? Why not keep them as speaker dependent, and do speaker-adaption for the new speaker at inference?\n\n3) In my opinion, it\u2019s a bit superfluous to name fine tuning as non-parametric few-shot adaption, and auxiliary network (speaker encoding) as parametric few-short adaption. Both ideas are quite natural as in Arik et al. (2018).\n\n4) The abbreviations SEA-ALL, SEA-EMB and SEA-ENC are appeared without explanation. \n\n5) It would be better to provide more details about early termination criterion in Section 3.1. Is it simply the validation loss?\n\n6) In Table 1, the MOS from Arik et al. (2018) and Jia et al. (2018) are not comparable. The experimental settings are different. Perhaps more importantly, these MOS evaluations are done by different group of people.\n\n7) In Section 5.3, Nachmani et al. (2018) and Arik et al. (2018) have also used speaker verification model as an objective evaluation.\n\nOverall, this is a good work with limited novelty but solid results. However, it can be improved in many ways as detailed  in previous comments. I would like to raise my rating if these comments can be addressed properly."

When facing a new environment, this policy must explore to identify its particular characteristics and then exploit this information for collecting reward.  We consider the online adaptation setting where the agent needs to trade-off between the two types of behaviour within the same episode. Even though policies based on recurrent neural networks can be used in this setting by training them on multiple environments, they often fail to model this trade-off, or solve it at a very high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that uses privileged information in the form of a task descriptor at train time to improve the learning of recurrent policies.  Our method learns an informed policy (i.e., a policy receiving as input the description of the current task) that is used to both construct task embeddings from the descriptors, and to regularize the training of the recurrent policy through parameters sharing and an auxiliary objective. This approach significantly reduces the learning sample complexity without altering the representational power of RNNs, by focusing on the relevant characteristics of the task, and by exploiting them efficiently.  We evaluate our algorithm in a variety of environments that require sophisticated exploration/exploitation strategies and show that it outperforms vanilla RNNs, Thompson sampling and the task-inference approaches to meta-reinforcement learning."

It is reward-driven learning and yet can make use of privileged information for efficient exploration. The advantage of the proposed method is verified in the experiments.\n\nComments on the paper\\\nI think the authors show an advantage of the proposed method by some experiments, but I\u2018d like to further request the following things to make the paper more convincing.\n\n1. Because the proposed method needs the task descriptor, it would be good to explain what kind of tasks we can apply the proposed method. The wider the applicability of the proposed method is, more valuable the proposed method would be. \n2. In the experiments, the authors compare with TS, TI and AuxTask. But I would like to see the comparison with another task embedding method, such as Pearl, K. Rakelly, et al., \"Efficient Off-Policy Meta-Reinforcement Learning via Probabilistic Context Variables,\" in ICML, 2019. I guess RNN makes the training of the exploitation policy more difficult because its latent code dynamically changes especially when the state space is large such as Maze3D environment. On the other hand, the task descriptor would not change. So RNN may sometimes makes the training difficult. We can use other embedding architecture for $f_H$ such as used in Pearl. I also would like to note that when the parameter of the dynamics is used as the task descriptor, it becomes similar to Homanga Bharadhwaj et al., \u201cMANGA: Method Agnostic Neural-policy Generalization and Adaptation\u201d, in ICRA 2020.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nUpdate\nThank you for the comments. But there is a misunderstanding. MANGA as well as PEARL are online methods. They just need the observed data during the episode. It can encode the observation data in online manner. I think it is not evident whether IMPORT performs better than MANGA or PERAL. I agree that RNN is general, but on the other hand, I am afraid that the internal state of RNN does not converge and usually fluctuate from time to time. It may be difficult to get a persistent policy during the episode in the same environment. I would like to encourage the authors to perform more convincing experiment and make the claim of the paper consistent with the experimental findings."

                "content": "Summary: This paper studies the exploration in meta-RL problem, where a meta-RL agent must both explore (to reduce uncertainty about the task) and then solve the task. Prior RNN approaches can theoretically learn the optimal policy, but optimization can be challenging. Instead, this paper opts to leverage additional information in the form of task-descriptors that specify the task, which make the learning process easier, because the task-descriptor provides the information normally discovered via exploration. In contrast to other task-descriptor approaches, which use Thompson Sampling for exploration (and can be arbitrarily sub-optimal in certain tasks), or auxiliary losses for predicting the task-descriptor (which may try to predict task-irrelevant information), this paper instead proposes to condition on the task-descriptor as an input to the policy during meta-training. Then an RNN policy is trained in two ways: first, conditioned on the task-descriptor, which enables learning to solve the task without requiring exploration; and second, conditioned on its own hidden state, which eventually replaces the task-descriptor at meta-test time. This approach outperforms prior approaches on a suite of tasks.\n\nStrengths:\n- Clarity. Generally, this paper presents a clear and coherent narrative. The motivation for the approach is clear (better leveraging task-descriptors compared to prior approaches to more easily learn informed policies). And the approach itself is also quite understandable.\n- Technical soundness. Furthermore, the approach appears to be technically sound. Leveraging the task-descriptor to learned informed policies, which are easier to optimize, can clearly produce some benefits. And then addressing the issue that the task-descriptor is unavailable at meta-test time by leveraging the hidden state also seems reasonable. The additional auxiliary loss to keep the recurrent state and task-descriptor embedding close also seems technically sound.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- Experiments. My main concern is that the experiments do not clearly substantiate the claims made in the main text:\n    - The introduction of the paper claims that IMPORT \u201cadapts faster to unknown environments, showing better generalization capabilities.\u201d From the learning curves in Figure 4, this is not clearly the case. In 4a), 4b) and 4c), other methods seem to be learning in roughly as many samples as IMPORT requires. Notably, 4d) does show some impressive improvements, but the general claim of faster learning isn\u2019t clearly supported by the current experiments. I was also unable to determine if the train / valid / test task splits overlapped at all, to evaluate the generalization to unknown environments part.\n    - The paper also states: \u201cWe evaluate IMPORT against the main approaches to online adaptation on environments that require sophisticated exploration/exploitation strategies.\u201d However, the environments used in the experiments, beyond the Maze3D environment don\u2019t appear to require sophisticated exploration. I would find the experiments more compelling if IMPORT was evaluated on more complex environments requiring sophisticated exploration, like Maze3D. In a similar vein, it\u2019s unclear to me what the takeaways from the results on the current environments should be: i.e., what does it mean about IMPORT if it performs slightly better than other approaches on CartPole or a tabular MDP? To be clear, I find evaluation on simpler environments to be useful if they clearly illustrate a point about the method, but it\u2019s unclear to me what that point is.\n    - One of the contributions of the approach, the auxiliary loss (C) is not clearly evaluated / ablated in the experiments. It appears that all of the experiments use the same value of $\\beta$? But it\u2019s not explicitly stated.\n    - Finally, it would be nice if the experiments substantiate the claim that IMPORT outperforms TI by avoiding \u201creconstructing features in the task descriptor that are irrelevant for learning.\u201d However, it\u2019s not clear to me that this is occurring in the experiments. Concretely, when both approaches are given task identifiers, this problem doesn\u2019t seem to exist, since only recovering the learning-relevant aspects is sufficient for predicting the identifier with TI. Similarly, it seems like the $\\mu$\u2019s used in the experiments contain mostly learning-relevant information.\n    - In addition to the concerns about supporting the paper\u2019s main claims, I have two additional concerns: First, the performance improvement from IMPORT is generally fairly modest. There\u2019s only a 3-5% gain over prior approaches in CartPole, and the TabularMDP, and the results on the bandits are mixed, although the results on Maze3D are impressive.\n    - Second, the TS baseline seems strangely implemented, as it\u2019s based on \u201cmaximizing the log-likelihood of $\\mu$.\u201d It\u2019s challenging to verify the details, because the paper states that they are in the appendix, but there is no appendix. In particular, for the bandits setting, it seems like TS should be updating a beta distribution over each arm, which I would expect to lead to stronger performance. Alternatively, it would be good to use prior approaches for TS, such as PEARL [1].\n\nGenerally, I find the proposed approach to be quite promising. This work convincingly states reasons why prior approaches (e.g., TS and task inference) sub-optimally leverage task-information. Yet, I find that the experiments insufficiently support the paper's claims, so I initially lean toward rejection.\n\nAdditional minor comments that did not affect my score:\n- Related works:\n    - The point about conditioning on a belief state with an RNN policy should probably cite [2].\n    - Thompson Sampling as an exploration policy in meta-RL should probably cite [1].\n    - [3] is also relevant to the exploration problem.\n- Several key details are missing from this paper, such as the details of the environments (e.g., what is $\\mu$ in the Maze3D task), which makes evaluating the experiments challenging. As mentioned above, these are reported to be in appendix, but there is no appendix.\n- It would be nice to know the failure mode of other approaches on the Maze3D environment.\n- The end of the setting section (Section 2) somewhat conflates the problem statement with the solution: i.e., the problem is maximizing returns, while the _proposed solution_ is \u201cto find an architecture for $\\pi$ that is able to express strategies that perform the best according to Eq. 1\u201c\n- \u201cthey approaches are sensitive\u201d \u2014> these approaches...\n\n[1] Kate Rakelly, Aurick Zhou, Deirdre Quillen, Chelsea Finn, and Sergey Levine.

In particular, I believe that the benchmarks can still be more carefully chosen to better evaluate IMPORT's ability to perform sophisticated exploration. I find the 3D Maze experiment to be quite nice, as it clearly highlights a shortcoming of TS exploration, but I would find the experiments more compelling if there were additional benchmarks testing such exploration. The authors commented that exploration in meta-RL is about inferring the task to solve, which I agree with, but I think such exploration can still be made more \"sophisticated\" by requiring careful sequences of actions to lead to distant states, which reveal this task information.\n\nIn addition, several issues were raised regarding the TS baseline during the discussion period. The results in the bandits setting appear to be lower than those reported in other works, and it still seems like PEARL can be adapted to be a drop-in replacement for the TS baseline. I agree with the authors' assessment that the basic form of PEARL explores the setting with multiple episodes, but PEARL could just resample from the posterior every few timesteps, which is already what happens in the TS baseline.\n\nI do think this work should be published in the future with a more careful selection of experiments."

                "content": "We thank you for the active discussion and multiple questions. To answer to your different points:\n1. RL^2 considers a different setting (which is different to ours and to the one in PEARL) where one trial is composed of multiple episodes: between each episode the agent returns to the first state (\u201cepisode always starts on the first state\u201d for T-MDP in [1]). IMPORT is only evaluated on one episode (without reset) which is a different setting (and more challenging since it does not allow \u2018retries\u2019). Moreover, in our setting, we are evaluating using train/test/validation tasks, evaluating the ability of the different models to generalize, which is not the setting of RL^2.  \n2. In the bandit setting, as far as we understand, one episode is just one single step and RL^2 is exactly our RNN baseline. Moreover their bandit setting is easier than the one we propose (uniform sampling of the reward probability on the arm): since the reward probability is sampled uniformly, multiple arms provide a reasonably good reward while in our setting, only one arm provides a good amount of reward. In the first case, one just has to identify a \u2018good\u2019 arm, while our setting needs the algorithm to identify the best arm. This is the reason why all the models we have compared perform less than UCB. \nWe have quickly relaunched experiments today on the MAB setting following the description provided in RL^2 (uniform sampling of the probability of the arms) for 5 and 10 arms with 100 timesteps. Our preliminary results are in line with the RL^2 paper in terms of numbers, with the RNN on par with UCB. IMPORT achieves a similar performance but seems to have a faster training. We are currently running more grid searches to finalize the results. \n3. In addition to the differences listed above, our T-MDP configuration is also different from RL^2 in the way we sample the rewards making the performance reported in the RL^2 paper and our article not directly comparable. But note that RL^2 is close to the RNN baseline, (just having the additional reset that our baseline does not use) and we show that IMPORT is competitive over RNN.\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02779"

For reference, the original RL^2 paper [1] also evaluates on the bandits task and tabular MDP task (with more states). The results may not be directly comparable between this work and [1], but [1] already shows that RL^2 outperforms UCB in the bandits task for both k = 10 and k = 50. Furthermore, RL^2 performs quite well in the tabular MDP task, although the evaluation in [1] uses 10 episodes, rather than just 1, as in this work. Consequently, regardless of whether these tasks are considered to require \"sophisticated exploration,\" it's unclear if IMPORT is learning better exploration behaviors than RL^2, which does not even require $\\mu$. This is my main hesitation for raising my score to recommend acceptance.\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02779"

                "content": "**Sophisticated exploration.**  The exploration (probing) we are talking about is not about the exploration of the states of the MDP during the training process,  but the fact the agent needs to choose actions that allow exploring the state-space to identify the task to solve. Solving the probing/exploitation trade-off online is a POMDP problem (since mu is hidden) and is difficult even if there are only a few mu-MDP states and actions. More precisely, the difficulty of the exploration (or probing) in the Tabular MDP setting comes from the fact that the task is defined by the transition probabilities and reward over states (resulting in potentially large mu vectors, even with few states). T-MDP corresponds to a case where the probing is particularly challenging: transitions are stochastic, so in order to perform optimally, the agent needs to probe relevant state-action pairs enough times before committing (similarly to the bandits task).\nWe will be more clear about this in the updated version.\n \n**TI baseline.**  Since TI is learned to approximate the whole mu vector (while IMPORT learns small size embeddings through the informed policy), it may take a large number of samples that will be used to approximate redundant or irrelevant mu features and reduce the sample efficiency. For instance, the RNN underlying TI may spend part of its capacity to approximate irrelevant features which is not the case with IMPORT. This is what we show in Figure 4c: when information is spread over multiple dimensions of mu, TI has difficulties to learn. It is also shown in Fig. 9 (in the appendix) where the capacity of the RNN is regulated by the embedding size: when embeddings are small, TI has more difficulties to select the relevant information than IMPORT which can rely on smaller task embeddings. \n\n\n**Thompson Sampling baseline.** As defined in the literature, Thompson Sampling maintains a posterior distribution on the parameters of the system it is facing (and not upon a latent variable). The originality of PEARL is to maintain such a distribution over a latent space, but this is not how Thompson Sampling is defined.  Maintaining a posterior over \\mu also enables to leverage available information about \\mu using a supervised objective instead of the sparse (and stochastic) reward signal. In the next version, as said previously, we will add the results on bandits using a Beta distribution as a \\mu belief distribution, as described in Section 3 of [1]. Note that, if it increases the performance of TS on bandits, it still does not change our conclusions.\nAt test time, the policy conditions on a sample from the posterior distribution: we re-sample from the posterior every k timesteps, with k an hyperparameter. As stated in Section 5, \u201cFor TS, an estimated \\mu is re-sampled from the posterior every k steps, k \u2208 {1, 5, 10, 20}\u201d and k is selected through the described protocol (using validation tasks, then reported results on the test tasks). \n\n[1] Daniel Russo, Benjamin Van Roy, Abbas Kazerouni, Ian Osband, Zheng Wen.

However, from the Appendix, the largest tabular MDP considered only consists of *5 states,* and the bandits task effectively only consists of a single state. This contrasts the literature on exploration in RL, which typically considers problems with many more states, or problems that require multiple time steps of exploration to reach distant states, (e.g., the classic chain MDP example in tabular exploration).\n\n**TI baseline.** Figure 4c does provide compelling empirical results. It's still not clear to me why uninformative or redundant dimensions are so problematic for TI, though. If a dimension x is redundant with dimension y, then predicting x well seems like it should also predict y well. If a dimension z is uninformative, it's clear that changing the hidden state representation to make it predictive of z shouldn't help at all, but it's not clear to me why it should harm performance\n\n**Thompson Sampling baseline.** The implementation of this baseline still seems somewhat odd to me. Rather than directly maintaining a posterior over $\\mu$'s , it seems like this baseline should maintain a posterior over a latent $z$, like PEARL. Generally, this baseline doesn't seem to type check, either. Typically, TS should involve resampling from the posterior every episode, and it's not clear when this baseline is resampling from the posterior, since there is only a single episode. With respect to the bandits task, it seems like TS in the bandits task should also update via the conjugate posterior of the beta distribution (itself another beta distribution), rather than just using a prior of the beta distribution. Using this, [1] reports significantly better results for TS in this bandits task.\n\n[1] https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.02038.pdf"

We use different task seeds to show that our method is robust across different sets of tasks.\nNow, for each task seed and method, we explore multiple hyperparameter values and follow the classical model selection schema: we select the best hyperparameter values on the validation tasks, and compute the performance of this selected policy on the test tasks.\n\nAt last, for each experiment (e.g Cartpole with N=10 and task identifiers) and methog (e.g. IMPORT, AuxTask\u2026), we report the average performance of the 3 best sets of HPs that have been selected on the 3 task seeds. Said otherwise, on the supervised learning problem, it would be like having 3 different train/test/validation datasets (e.g ImageNet, CIFAR, MNIST), doing a separate model selection over each dataset, and then reporting an average performance, which seems a realistic setting. \nWhile this selection method allows us to average performance obtained with different hyperparameter values for different task seeds, it appears that, in practice, given an experiment and a method, the value of the best hyperparameters is actually the same on all the task seeds. \n\nWe will make this more clear in the next version of the paper submitted before the end of the rebuttal period.\n"

An arm probability vector is sampled at the beginning of the episode and remains constant during the episode.  The agent is allowed to pull an arm in [1, K] at each timestep and observes the resulting reward. It can thus identify the best arm (like UCB) by pulling them multiple times, and then pull the best arm, resulting in a policy which is more efficient than a random one. This is what IMPORT (and other baselines) is doing: discovering an efficient exploration policy that does not \u2018consume\u2019 too much reward. \n\nOur evaluation setting is a perfect fit for environments as bandits as the trade-off between probing and exploitation is of utmost importance.

In our setting, at evaluation time, a task is sampled and the performance of an algorithm is measured as the cumulative reward during a single episode. At the end of the episode, a new task is sampled. This is what we call the 'online  adaptation' setting, because the policy must explore as little as possible to maximize the reward on a single episode. This setting is standard in Meta-RL  literature [1,2], including Task Inference, which we compare to.\n\nIn contrast, PEARL, DREAM and MANGA have been developed and evaluated in a setting where at evaluation time, a task is sampled, and then 1) the learner is given a few \u201cfree\u201d' episodes or transitions form this task (off- or on-policy, depending on the paper), followed by 2) one or several episodes. The test performance is defined as the cumulative reward collected on step 2) only. Such meta-learning settings are different from ours because stage 1) allows the policy to perform system identification while ignoring the task reward. We did not compare to these algorithms because of this discrepancy in problems addressed.\n\n[1] Wenhao Yu, Jie Tan, C. Karen Liu, Greg Turk.

                "content": "We thank you for the constructive comments. We would like to point out that the appendix contains additional experiments and is available in the supplementary material file (the .zip file) submitted and available at the time of review.   We will update the paper to move important points of the current supplementary material  into the main paper. \n\nTo be more precise on the points you raised:\n\na. We consider the problem of generalization to new tasks, that is why the set of train/validation and test tasks are different without overlap between the tasks (except in the Maze3d experiment where only two goal locations are possible - the objective of the Maze3d experiment was not to test the generalization ability, but the capacity of the model to scale to high dimensional input spaces where the mapping between pixel inputs and \\mu is complicated).\n\nFigure 4 does not show an improvement in terms of sample efficiency for the Cartpole environment, because CartPole needs a very simple exploration strategy (basically, doing random transitions is enough to identify the task to solve). We included CartPole to showcase that IMPORT\u2019s learned representations lead to better generalization than other methods (Table 1). We would like to point out the results obtained on problems where the exploration is more complex like Bandits (Figure 13 of the appendix), tabular MDP (Figure 16) and Maze3d (Figure 15) where the improvement in terms of sample efficiency is clear. Again, these results are in the appendix for sake of space, but we will resubmit an updated version at the end of the discussion period with the additional page containing some of these curves to support our claims.\n\nb. The Bandits and Tabular-MDP (Appendix C.3 and C5) environments are two typical examples of problems where the exploration is complicated. For instance, in the Bandit environment, since IMPORT needs to address the exploration/exploitation trade-off, it needs to discover strategies like UCB, which is far from being simple to learn just from interactions. For the tabular MDP, the agent has to estimate both the reward and transition probabilities while trying to stay in high-reward states which is also a complicated strategy. Control problems (i.e CartPole and Acrobot) are mainly used to demonstrate the generalization ability of our method and we agree that they involve simpler exploration strategies.\n\nc. Following your suggestion, we performed an ablation study for the auxiliary loss. It shows that in all environments (CartPole, Acrobot, Bandits) except Tabular MDP, IMPORT benefited from the supervised auxiliary objective (in terms of sample efficiency and final performance).   The curves will be added in the appendix of the next version of the paper, which we will submit at the end of the discussion period.\n\nd. First of all, one of the \u2018structural\u2019 differences between TI and IMPORT is that TI tends to reconstruct the whole \\mu information, while IMPORT is focused on the relevant part of mu discovered by learning the informed policy. Figure 4c describes an experiment where relevant information is spread over multiple features. In this case, some of the created features are almost uninformative (or redundant with other features) and the results show that IMPORT outperforms TI. \n\ne. In addition to results on Maze3d,  IMPORT  clearly outperforms all the other methods on Tabular MDP (Fig.  16  in the current version of the appendix), both in terms of sample efficiency and final performance.\n\nf. The appendix was provided in the supplementary material file together with the submission. The way we implemented TS is the following: the informed policy is used to sample episodes on which a) the log-likelihood of \\mu is maximized (and computed using a RNN) b) the policy is updated to maximize the task reward.  As explained in the related work section of the paper, such training does not allow the agent to learn probing as it always acts according to an informed policy.  To circumvent this, we implemented a new version that samples from the posterior \\mu distribution even at train time, yielding better results (though not matching IMPORT, AuxTask and TI\u2019s results). We also ran TS, AuxTask and TI on bandits with a prior beta distribution: results are slightly better but still IMPORT is better when K=20. We will add those to the appendix in the next version of the paper. \n\ng. As we discuss in the comment to all reviewers, PEARL is using a different evaluation protocol. \n\nAn updated version of the paper will be resubmitted ASAP. \n"

We performed experiments with two types of task descriptors: \na) a set of task features, \nb) the weakest possible information about the task, i.e. a task identifier / index of the train task.  \nAccess to such a \\mu during training is a common assumption in the MTRL literature  and captures a large variety of  concrete problems: \nType a) informative \\mu at train time  is a common assumption in the literature of domain randomization [1, 2] and multi-task [3].  It is particularly relevant for problems when we have prior knowledge on physical parameters of the environment and/or the agent (robotics) or the reward function (e.g. the speed target in half cheetah). \nType b) (See [4, 5])) mu information is less restrictive and corresponds to a large number of problems: learning in a set of N training levels in a video game, learning to drive on N different vehicles, learning to interact with N different users, learning to control N different robots, etc\u2026 \nIn the two cases, IMPORT can use these tasks identifiers to generalize well. Moreover,. experimental results on  CartPole (Fig. 6) and Tabular MDP (Fig. 16) suggest that the type a) improves sample efficiency, however it does not change the final performance. Equivalent final performances of IMPORT on both types of privileged information is a desirable property and shows our method is agnostic to task descriptors.\n\n2. As explained in the comment to all reviewers, the comparison with PEARL, MANGA, DREAM is not trivial because these models have been developed in a different setting. For instance,  MANGA uses \u201cfree\u201d off-policy data for task identification, whereras IMPORT in an online method where the identification is made during the episode. The collected reward that we report in our paper considers the \u2018price\u2019 of the task identification, while it is ignored in the MANGA approach. Thus, MANGA does not need to address the exploration/exploitation dilemma that IMPORT addresses.\nWe agree with the reviewer that using  the factored Gaussians architecture of PEARL could be an alternative to our RNN. Nonetheless, this is orthogonal to the main idea of IMPORT, and the RNN is a more general architecture with which we obtained good results, so we decided to keep it in the paper.\n\nAn updated version of the paper will be resubmitted ASAP. \n\n[1] Bhairav Mehta, Manfred Diaz, Florian Golemo, Christopher J.

The informed policy helps the discovery of the recurrent policy that efficiently manages the exploration/exploitation trade-off.  Moreover it helps in two ways:\na) transfer to the recurrent policy through weight sharing: previous approaches did not leverage the privileged information during trajectory rollouts.\nb) providing a task embedding that is focused on the information minimally relevant for the task to solve while approaches like TI and AuxTask are based on an auxiliary supervised objective whose target can contain irrelevant or misleading information.

The task information (\\mu) is available only at train time.

Again, at test and validation time, only the recurrent policy is used, the informed policy being only updated on the training environments where the task information or task identifier is known. \u201cOnline adaptation\u201d is done thanks to the internal state of the RNN being updated at each time-step (contrary to weight updates in MAML approaches).\n\n- All curves in the paper correspond to the performance obtained on testing tasks, thus showing the ability of IMPORT to generalize to unseen tasks. \n\n- To correctly evaluate generalization to unseen environments, we use the following model selection strategy, as done in the supervised learning  paradigm:\nWe train policies on training tasks, and collect their performances on validation and test tasks.

In this work, we introduce autoregressive (AR) poisoning, a method that can generate poisoned data without access to the broader dataset. The proposed AR perturbations are generic, can be applied across different datasets, and can poison different architectures.

In some related literature, designing adaptive attacks is considered necessary to verify the effectiveness of defenses, and lacking adaptive attacks is a weakness or limitation mentioned in many reviews. So the limitation remains. But I do not think it is a big limitation. So I raise the score to 5 since the contributions overweigh the weakness and limitation.\n\n"

Designing denoisers for autoregressive perturbations, which are generated using AR processes unknown to the victim, requires that the denoiser be agnostic to the exact AR process. Even if AR coefficients were leaked, there would still be 372 floating point values unknown to the victim (because we sample our starting signal from a Gaussian for a 32x32x3 image and an AR process that uses a window size 3x3) (Figure 3, Left). Recovering or removing perturbations is a challenging direction for future work, but developing novel defense techniques is beyond the scope of this paper.  \n\nFurthermore, while adding AR perturbations to training data makes the data easy to fit, estimating the noise from poisoned data may be very challenging, perhaps no less challenging than estimating perturbations added under other indiscriminate poisoning attacks, such as error-max perturbations [1].  We emphasize that how easy the noised training data is to fit is **not** related to the difficulty of recovering the clean data after the noise is applied. Error-max and Error-min perturbations are \u201calmost linearly separable\u201d [2] and yet denoisers which remove perturbations under indiscriminate poisoning attacks to recover model performance remain elusive. The possibility of denoisers as a defense can just as easily be raised against other indiscriminate poisoning methods. We do think this is an interesting direction, and defenses are worth pursuing. If we have addressed your feedback, we hope you will consider increasing your score.\n\n[1] Adversarial Examples Make Strong Poisons, NeurIPS 2021\n\n[2] Availability Attacks Create Shortcuts, KDD 2022"

The relation between Lemma 3.1 and the effectiveness of the proposed method in poisoning attacks is not obvious.\n\nWe thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have rewritten Section 3.3 for clarity, focusing on our logic and its relationship to Lemma 3.1. Here is the relevant portion of the new text: A signal that is easily interpolated by a network will be quickly identified and used as a \u201cshortcut,\u201d whereas complex and unpredictable patterns may not be learned until after a network has already extracted useful content-based features [8]. We propose a simple hypothesis: if there exists a simple CNN that can classify autoregressive signals perfectly, then these signals will be easy to learn. By showing that AR filters exist, Lemma 3.1 helps us define the simple CNN that classifies AR signals perfectly. Our experiments demonstrate that our method, motivated by our simple hypothesis, is effective.\n\n### Responses to questions\n> Is the proposed method only applicable to computer vision tasks?\n\nWe only develop perturbations for images, but an AR perturbation can be crafted for any continuous signal. We speculate that our method could work for audio classification as well. We show that AR patterns are easily learned by CNNs, and they are applicable to any setting where you would use a CNN.\n\nThank you again for your feedback. We think that your suggestions have improved our paper.

AR perturbations may have single entries which are high and violate a strict $\\ell_{\\infty}$ constraint. Still, our proposed perturbations can be projected onto any $\\ell_p$-norm ball, including $\\ell_{\\infty}$. To demonstrate that AR poisoning *can* work in the $\\ell_{\\infty}$-norm constrained setting, we provide CIFAR-10 test accuracy for a RN-18, where perturbations are of size $\\frac{8}{255}$ in $\\ell_{\\infty}$-norm. \n\n|                       | Standard Aug | +Cutout | +CutMix | +Mixup |\n|-----------------------|--------------|---------|---------|--------|\n| AR (Ours)              |     20.49    |  26.93  |  17.08  |  15.22 |\n\nImportantly, how one fits an AR perturbation $\\delta$ within the constraint that $\\lVert \\delta \\rVert_{\\infty} \\leq \\epsilon = \\frac{8}{255}$ affects performance.

We have updated Table 4 (with standard deviation over 4 independent runs), and we see that, in all but one case, adding our poisoned data to clean data reduces the test accuracy of models, so we can indeed effectively prevent others from leveraging our data.

This means that even if AR coefficients were leaked, there would still be 372 floating point values unknown to the victim (for a 32x32x3 image with an AR process that uses a window size 3x3).

This goal, namely preventing the addition of poisoned data from boosting accuracy, is standard in the literature [4, 5, 6, 7].\n\n| Poison/Clean Proportion | 40%            | 30%            | 20%            | 10%            | 5%           |\n|-------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Clean             | 90.29 &pm; 0.38 | 88.57 &pm; 0.34 | 85.17 &pm; 1.10 | 74.65 &pm; 4.41 | 70.20 &pm; 5.22 |\n| AR (Ours)         | 87.63 &pm; 0.68 | 85.62 &pm; 0.62 | 83.28 &pm; 0.90 | 76.13 &pm; 2.34 | 62.69 &pm; 5.58 |\n| Difference         | -2.66               | -2.95               | -1.89                | +1.48              | -7.51             |\n\nTaking the reviewer\u2019s suggestion, we have also performed new experiments when the poison proportion is under 60% (i.e. when clean proportion exceeds 40%).

Specifically, we consider 3 optimizers: SGD, SGD+Momentum ($\\beta=0.9$ and Adam ($\\beta_1=0.9$, $\\beta_2=0.999$). We also consider 3 different learning-rate schedules: cosine learning-rate, single-step decay (epoch 50) and multi-step decay (epoch 50, epoch 75) with decay factor of 0.1. Thus, there are a total of 9 optimizer and learning rate combinations. In the following table, for each poison, we report mean CIFAR-10 test accuracy over the 9 combinations of optimizers and learning rates. Our proposed method remains nearly unaffected by choice of hyperparameters, and performs better than all other poisons.\n\n| AR (Ours)      | Random          | Regions-4     | Regions-16     | Error-Max    | Error-Min       |\n|----------------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| 12.23 &pm; 1.22 | 33.39 &pm; 31.24 | 22.89 &pm; 7.6 | 18.73 &pm; 5.52 | 16.6 &pm; 2.8 | 22.96 &pm;  7.16 |\n\n> Unclear how one compares performance of different correlated noises\n\nAll the poisons we consider use the ground truth label as a dependent variable to generate the perturbations. Thus, poisons we consider contain perturbations that may be correlated with the ground truth. While there is an intractable number of possible noise patterns that could be used to perturb data and induce a correlation, we prove that AR perturbations have a particular structure which allows a manually-specified CNN filter to detect it perfectly (Lemma 3.1). Thus, AR perturbations are correlated noise designed for convolutional layers. By making sure that poisons we consider are bounded by the same $\\ell_2$ perceptibility constraint, we are able to compare performance between different kinds of correlated noise.\n"

In essence, data here gets perturbed with correlated noise such that when learning is attempted, models learn to focus on the noise rather than on the true features useful for generalisation. While prior work focused on generating class-wise poisons, in this work the noise is generated per sample using a Markov process, producing linearly separatable noise. Paper thoroughly evaluates the setting and demonstrates that the approach effectively stops generalisation when the whole dataset is poisoned and struggles in a similar way in presence of adversrail training or dilution with clean data.  \nStrengths:\n+ Interesting setting\n+ Idea of hardness of learning is rather fascinating\n\nWeaknesses:\n+ Unclear how much of the evaluation is an artifact of chosen optimisation hyperparameters\n+ Unclear how one compares performance of different correlated noises Thank you very much for the paper, it is a very interesting read!

What is the fundamental difference between the noises in the related literature and the one produced in the paper? This naturally leads to my final question.\n3.

                "content": " This paper proposes a new data poisoning attack to prevent data scraping. The proposed method adds class conditional autoregressive (AR) noise to training data to prevent people from using the data for training, and the method is data and model independent, which means that the same noise can be used to poison different datasets and models of different architectures.\n\nThe intuition behind the idea is that easy to learn noise is more effective at data poisoning, and AR noise generated in the proposed way is easy for neural network to learn. The authors show that a manually specified 3-layer CNN with AR filter can easily learn class information from the AR noise. Experiments on four benchmark datasets (CIFAR10, STL10, SVHN, CIFAR100) show that the proposed method performs better than other four baselines (Error-min, Error-max, Regions, Random noise). Strengths:\n\n- The proposed method is novel as autoregressive process hasn't been used before to do data poisoning. The method is easy to implement and the same AR coefficients can be used for different datasets and architectures as long as the numbers of classes are the same. Though code is not available, pseudo code (algorithms) and implementation details are provided. It is better that if actual code can be provided for reproduction of the results.\n\n- The paper is well-written and easy to follow. Empirical results on four different datasets show that the method performs better than other baselines, both under normal setting and defense settings.\n\nWeakness:\n\n- Though the proposed method performs better than other baselines compared in the paper, when tested against adversarial training, the performance is not satisfactory. It performs similarly to other baselines under this setting and the poisoning effect is not good, especially when the radii is large.\n\n- As pointed out in the paper, assuming that all the data can be poisoned is not realistic. In section 4.3.3, the poisoning methods are evaluated using a mix of poisoned and clean data. Under this setting, the performance of the proposed method is not good and similar to those of other baselines.\n\n About the process of AR noise generation:\n\n- It is clear how to generate AR noise at the beginning inside the sliding window. How about the subsequent steps? Take the example in Figure 2 as an example, if the sliding window slides one step to the right, there are three values to be generated. Are $x_{t-7}$ up to $x_t$ used to generate the next one ($x_{t+1}$)? Then $x_{t-6}$ up to $x_{t+1}$ are used to generate $x_{t+2}$, and so on.  The author points out that the method does not perform well against adversarial training and experiments show that when evaluated using a mix of poisoned and clean data, the performance is also not good."

The proposed method does not rely on optimizations while generic towards different model architectures and different datasets. This paper also provides insight into why the proposed method is effective. \n Strengths:\n- The proposed method is efficient and technically sound. Existing works rely on optimizations which is the bottleneck. The proposed method does not rely on optimizations, and the parameters for AR are easy to find.  \n- The existing works are also shown that do not transfer well between model architectures or datasets. Experiment results show that one set of AR is generic across different architectures or datasets. \n- The efficient and generic can be very practical considering real-world applications.\n- Experiment results also demonstrated AR generated unlearnable examples are more robust towards augmentations.\n\n---\nLimitations:\n- Once the data is released, the defender may not modifies the data anymore, and the model trainer can retroactively apply new models/methods [1]. The adaptive case should be carefully examined. Consider that if the parameters for AR are leaked, can it be used to recover the original image? Or if a portion of the clean images are leaked, using pair of clean and unlearnable versions, is it possible to reverse the AR process? \n- In section 3.3, the assertion that the noises are easy to learn is more effective for poisoning, this could also mean they are easy to detect. Such as calculating sample-specific loss at the end of each training epoch. Although only detecting such samples does not make them \"learnable,\" but adaptive method (if there are any) can be applied to these samples. Or the model trainer could wait for future advancement for the recovery method as mentioned in [1]. \n\n[1] Data Poisoning Won\u2019t Save You From Facial Recognition, ICML 2021 Workshop AML\n\n---\nAfter the author's response, I increased my rating score to 7.

The assumption of high poison rate is very strong. In practice, if the data is collected from multiple sources, then the attack is not effective? In the case that the data is collected from one source (the adversary), the entity who trains the model would be more cautious about the quality of data due to the high risk when the data only comes from one source.\n\n3. Section 3.3 is not easy to follow, and the logic is not very clear. I think Section 3.3 is one of the most important parts in the paper since it explains why the proposed method works. After reading Section 3.3, I am still very confused. The relation between Lemma 3.1 and the effectiveness of the proposed method in *poisoning attacks* is not obvious. \n 1. Is the proposed method only applicable to $\\ell_2$ norm?\n2. The proposed attack requires high poison rate to be effective?\n3. Is the proposed method only applicable to computer vision tasks? 1.

We find that current large language models are significantly undertrained, a consequence of the recent focus on scaling language models whilst keeping the amount of training data constant. By training over 400 language models ranging from 70 million to over 16 billion parameters on 5 to 500 billion tokens, we find that for compute-optimal training, the model size and the number of training tokens should be scaled equally: for every doubling of model size the number of training tokens should also be doubled. We test this hypothesis by training a predicted compute-optimal model, Chinchilla, that uses the same compute budget as Gopher but with 70B parameters and 4$\\times$ more data. Chinchilla uniformly and significantly outperformsGopher (280B), GPT-3 (175B), Jurassic-1 (178B), and Megatron-Turing NLG (530B) on a large range of downstream evaluation tasks. This also means that Chinchilla uses substantially less compute for fine-tuning and inference, greatly facilitating downstream usage. As a highlight, Chinchilla reaches a state-of-the-art average accuracy of 67.5% on the MMLU benchmark, a 7% improvement over Gopher. "

We have updated the text to make this clear.\n* Question 2: For Curation Corpus, Wikitext103, and LAMBADA we did perform test set filtering. However for the Pile, MMLU, and BIG-Bench we did not perform test set filtering as they are were collected after MassiveText was collected. There is a discussion on the test set filtering in \u201cScaling Language Models: Methods, Analysis & Insights from Training Gopher\u201d [2022]. In general, a better understanding of test set filtering and the impact it has in the extreme data regime is very important. However as Gopher and Chinchilla were trained on the same data we suspect the impact to be small, even though Chinchilla did see much more data. Additionally, the degree to which Chinchilla outperformed Gopher across many tasks (including BIG-Bench tasks) which are unlikely to be present in the training data suggests that the performance gains are not due to leakage.\n* Question 3 + Weakness 1: Better metrics to quantify how a model is undertrained is a very important research question, however one that we have not yet systematically approached. In the supplement, we show Figure A4 which attempts to provide some early quantification of this question. Specifically we show a model trained based on the approach from Kaplan et al compared to that which our analysis suggests. We find that a smaller model trained on more data is more performant.\n* With respect to the random seeds: for training these language models (smaller and larger), there is minimal variance between random seeds and therefore there is no benefit in running multiple seeds.

                "content": " This paper presents an empirical study to explore the scaling law for training Transformer-based large language models (LLM). In this paper, the scaling law is the trade-off between model size and training tokens, and it is explored by different fitting methods. To obtain the empirical data for fitting the scaling curves, the authors train various language models by varying the model size and the training FLOP counts. The estimated power-law relationship indicates that the optimal scaling way is to increase the size of training data equally while enlarging the model size. To verify the correctness of this optimal scaling law, the authors train the *Chinchilla* model with larger training tokens but decrease the model size to 70B compared to *Gopher* (280B). According to the evaluation results shown in Appendix H, *Chinchilla* outperforms other *Gopher* on most benchmarks while sharing the same FLOPs cost. \n\nThe contributions of this paper are as follows: 1) refining the existing scaling law explored by *Gopher*; 2) revealing an optimal scaling law regarding the training tokens and model size for training LLMs.\n **Strength**:\n1. ***Significance***: The scaling law explored in this empirical study is useful to train the LLM. The authors also claim that the current LLMs are under-trained, the conclusion in this paper may show an interesting direction for this community to keep optimizing the LLMs: we need to pay attention to efficiently learning the data instead of enlarging the model size.\n2. ***Originality***: Although this paper follows the research methodology of a previous study [1], i.e., an empirical study, this paper eventually shows a new scaling law. \n\n**Weakness**:\n1. ***Soundness***: Since this paper uses the empirical method to explore the optimal scaling law, the theoretical foundation is not very solid. How can we judge whether a model is under-trained in a more sound way? Besides, given that the three modeling approaches in this paper rely on empirical training records, one problem is the random factors of training. As the authors claimed in Checklist 3.(c), the costs of training these models are expensive, they did not perform training with different random seeds.\n2. ***Clarity***: This paper is easy to follow and well-written. But there are some typos in the paper:\n    - Line 1: a transformer -> a Transformer\n    - Line 37: budget, Instead, -> budget, instead\n    - Line 71: [24] first -> Kaplan et al. [24] first \n    - Line 74: differs from [24] -> differs from Kaplan et al.

In Section 3.1 (Line 130), you mentioned that smoothing and interpolation methods were applied to each training loss curve. I found the details of the smoothing method in Appendix D.1. But which interpolation method did you use in Approach 1?\n2. Have you examined the overlap between pre-training data and downstream fine-tuning data? (especially for the evaluation of language modeling tasks)\n3. You mentioned that current LLMs are under-trained. Is there any metric to evaluate the bottleneck of model capacity instead of empirical methods?\n\n***Update***: The authors have replied to Q1, Q2 with further clarification. - Societal Impact: The societal impact is positive. For those researchers who work on developing large-scale language models, the authors provide a useful scaling law to save the computational budget. \n- Limitation: The major limitation still lies in the research methodology, the empirical study may not always be solid as I stated in the Weaknesses part.\n"

(2020) suggested that large models should not be trained to their lowest possible loss to be compute-optimal: instead, model size should grow faster than the size of the training set, given a fixed computational budget increase. \nThis paper is a more thorough investigation of the question: what are the optimal model size and number of training tokens for a given training budget, tuning additional hyperparameters ignored by prior work? The authors find that model size and training budget should, in fact and in contrast to prior findings, be scaled equally -- since this isn't typically done, many state-of-the-art models are undertrained. They then use this insight to train a new model (which they call Chinchilla), which uses more data but the same compute as a state-of-the-art model and significantly outperforms the latter on multiple downstream tasks.  Strengths:\n- This paper provides experimental results that contradict previous findings and might be quite consequential for the future of large language models. \n- The experiments are quite extensive.

The celebrated Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) policy is among the simplest optimism-based MAB algorithms that naturally adapts to this gap: for a horizon of play n, it achieves optimal O(log n) regret in instances with \"large\" gaps, and a near-optimal O(\\sqrt{n log n}) minimax regret when the gap can be arbitrarily \"small.\" This paper provides new results on the arm-sampling behavior of UCB, leading to several important insights. Among these, it is shown that arm-sampling rates under UCB are asymptotically deterministic, regardless of the problem complexity. This discovery facilitates new sharp asymptotics and a novel alternative proof for the O(\\sqrt{n log n}) minimax regret of UCB. Furthermore, the paper also provides the first complete process-level characterization of the MAB problem in the conventional diffusion scaling. Among other things, the \"small\" gap worst-case lens adopted in this paper also reveals profound distinctions between the behavior of UCB and Thompson Sampling, such as an \"incomplete learning\" phenomenon characteristic of the latter.\n"

For the two-arm case, the asymptotic behavior of arm sampling is characterized for different regimes (small, large, and medium) of suboptimality gap. Using this characterization, the minimax regret of UCB is shown to O(n\\logn), where n is the time horizon. They highlight the incomplete learning phenomenon in Thomson sampling where sample-split could be arbitrarily imbalanced along a sample path even when both the arms have the same mean.  The paper highlights the important aspect of arm sampling distribution in the Multi-armed setting. The author nicely built the imbalances in arm sampling through examples for both UCB and Thompson sampling. The insights from the analysis highlight the 'incomplete learning' learning aspect in Thompson sampling.\n\nI have the following question for the authors: \n\nTheorem 1: The result holds aysmptotically and $\\Delta$ (problem instance) is changing with $n$. After $n$ rounds (sufficiently large), we expect UCB to have played the optimal arm exponentially more time than the sub-optimal arm. But the asymptotic result suggests that this need not be the case if $\\Delta \\rightarrow 0$ as $n \\rightarrow$.

The statement assumes $n\\rightarrow \\infty$, but the Proof Sketch says for any $n \\in \\mathcal{N}$, which one is correct.\n\nTheorem 3: Does the result hold with weaker condition $\\Delta \\rightarrow 0$ Instead of thanking $\\Delta \\sim \\sqrt{\\frac{\\theta \\log n}{n}}$.\n\nOverall nice paper.

                "content": "Classical bandit algorithms such as UCB and Thompson Sampling are well-understood in terms of their performance\u2014for example, an upper bound on their regret\u2014but, until recently, little attention has been given to their actual behavior\u2014for example, the rates at which specific arms are sampled. This work seeks to address these questions by analyzing the arm sampling distribution achieved by both UCB and Thompson Sampling. They provide results characterizing these distributions asymptotically and, in addition, characterize the distribution of the rewards obtained by running UCB.  While the regret incurred by UCB and Thompson Sampling (TS) is well-understood, this work seeks to understand the actual behavior of these algorithms. It makes several contributions in this direction, all in the two-armed bandit problem (though some of the results extend to K arms). In particular, they characterize the:\n- Asymptotic distribution of N_{I*}(n)/n achieved by UCB, where N_{I*}(n) is the number of pulls of the optimal arm up to time n, for various regimes of the gap.\n- Asymptotic distribution of N_{I*}(n)/n achieved by TS but in a restricted regime where the rewards are deterministic.\n- Precise regret incurred by UCB asymptotically, establishing that R_n -> c(\\theta)*\\sqrt{n log n} for some problem-dependent constant c(\\theta).\n- Distribution of the random process of the UCB\u2019s reward and regret.\n\nAll results are asymptotic in nature (i.e. the number of samples n -> infinity). In addition, the authors provide several numerical examples illustrating that in practice UCB and TS can exhibit surprising behavior, and show that they are able to explain this behavior with their theoretical results.\n\nPros:\n- This is a timely work. In the last few years, a significant amount of attention has been given to understanding the asymptotically optimal regret of bandit problems (e.g. [4]), as well as properties of UCB (for example, the bias in the estimates of the arm means maintained by UCB [1]). Very recently [5] studied the asymptotic sampling distribution of Thompson Sampling but, to my knowledge, no other works on this exist, though open questions still remain.\n- The results are extensive and provide a full characterization of the behavior of the UCB algorithm, greatly deepening our understanding of its properties. The motivating examples help make clear that there are unusual and little-understood effects that occur when running UCB and TS.\n\nCons:\n- The main results only hold for a two-armed bandit model, though they are partially extended in the appendix to K armed models (the restriction to two-armed bandits has precedence in the literature though, for instance [4]). \n- The results on Thompson Sampling only holds for deterministic bandits. Furthermore, [5] studies the asymptotic distributions of the arm pulls of Thompson Sampling and should be cited and compared against. \n- There\u2019s a line of recent work ([1]-[3]) which aims to understand the bias of optimistic bandit algorithms. While not directly comparable to this work, it is related to the theme of understanding the behavior of bandit algorithms, and should be cited.\n- Some discussion on the applications of these results would be interesting. For example, do these results motivate any improvements to UCB or other algorithms?\n\nOverall, this is a thorough study of the performance of bandit algorithms, greatly deepens our understanding of both UCB, and warrants an accept. \n\n----------------------------\n\nUpdate after rebuttal: I would like to maintain my score after reading the rebuttal.

This is still an evolving landscape. A recent paper [Lin Fan and Peter W Glynn. Diffusion approximations for Thompson sampling. arXiv preprint arXiv:2105.09232, 2021] appeared post our submission; cited paper derives a diffusion limit for Thompson Sampling in the Gaussian bandit setting (distinct from our Beta-Bernoulli setting) and does so using a very different framework that is not directly applicable to our setting. Moreover, unlike the closed-form limit for UCB (Theorem 4 in our paper), the limit-process for Thompson Sampling can only be characterized in terms of solutions (possibly non-unique) to a stochastic ordinary differential equation driven by a time-changed Brownian motion. The complex nature of the limit has to do with the non-degeneracy of the distribution of $N_i(n)/n$ under Thompson Sampling as $n\\to\\infty$, when $\\Delta \\asymp 1/\\sqrt{n}$; a special case of this phenomenon is the \"imperfect learning\" observable in instances with \"zero gap,\" which Theorem 2 in our paper formalizes in the deterministic setting. It is readily observable empirically that non-degeneracy in the asymptotic distribution of $N_i(n)/n$ persists up to diffusion-scale $\\mathcal{O}\\left( 1/\\sqrt{n} \\right)$ gaps under Thompson Sampling, both in the Beta-Bernoulli as well as the Gaussian setting (see [25] for a few examples in the Gaussian setting). Theoretical development in this area is still in its initial stages at the moment, and we hope Theorem 2 provides a useful starting iterate for further investigations into this aspect of Thompson Sampling.\n\nWe have noted the minor points raised as well, and will duly address them in the revision.

We greatly appreciate your feedback; point-wise responses to your main remarks are provided below.\n\n$(i)$ On the connection between Theorem 4 and the derivation in [25]. The distinctions have been discussed in Lines 317-320, and again in Lines 344-354 in the paper. In a nutshell, [25] uses the martingale framework developed by [Daniel W Stroock and SR Srinivasa Varadhan. Multidimensional diffusion processes. Springer, 2007] to characterize the diffusion limit for algorithms satisfying certain regularity conditions, whereas we derive Theorem 4 for UCB [6] directly from first principles. More importantly, our work is independent of [25] as the latter's framework cannot be applied to UCB due to a violation of the aforementioned regularity conditions under UCB. In fact, the framework of [25] is quite limited insofar as its applicability to the study of bandit algorithms; in addition to  UCB, both versions of Thompson Sampling discussed in [2] also remain outside the ambit of the analysis in [25].\n\n$(ii)$ On the difficulty of deriving diffusion approximations for general algorithms. As noted in the paper, the fact that $N_i(n)/n \\xrightarrow{p} 1/2$ for both arms $i=1,2$ under UCB when $\\Delta \\asymp 1/\\sqrt{n}$, is crucial for the diffusion-limit process to admit a closed-form characterization as stated in Theorem 4. Theorem 2 shows that the aforementioned condition $\\left(N_i(n)/n \\xrightarrow{p} 1/2\\right)$ is provably violated under Thompson Sampling in the Beta-Bernoulli bandit setting. In fact, similar empirical observations are available also in the Gaussian bandit setting. The [Fan and Glynn] reference you mention, derives a diffusion-limit process for Thompson Sampling in the Gaussian bandit setting using a very different framework that is not directly applicable to our setting. Moreover, unlike our result for UCB, the limit-process in their work can only be characterized in terms of solutions (possibly non-unique) to a stochastic ordinary differential equation driven by a time-changed Brownian motion. This characterization has to do with the non-deterministic nature of $N_i(n)/n$ under Thompson Sampling when $\\Delta \\asymp 1/\\sqrt{n}$. Presently, we are unaware of a general strategy for deriving diffusion approximations for bandit algorithms. Our approach is tailored to UCB (and UCB-like) algorithms under which $N_i(n)/n \\xrightarrow{p} c$ when $\\Delta \\asymp 1/\\sqrt{n}$, where $c$ is some constant bounded away from $0$ and $1$. The work in [Fan and Glynn] is specific to Thompson Sampling in the Gaussian bandit setting. As discussed earlier, [25] proposes a general framework to derive diffusion approximations. However, their conditions are restrictive and the classical versions of UCB as well as Thompson Sampling remain outside the ambit of their analysis. \n\n$(iii)$ Miscellaneous. A simple extension of Theorem 1 to the $K$-armed setting is  provided in Appendix B. A full-scale generalization involves messy book-keeping since $K(K-1)/2$ pairwise gaps are involved, but this can be done in principle (though we felt it is outside the scope of the present conference paper).  Of the three references suggested, [Fan and Glynn] is certainly relevant to our work; thank you for bringing this to our notice. [Hirano and Porter] and [Araman and Caldentey] study diffusion limits in broader settings involving sequential experiments (which are quite distinct in nature from our bandit paradigm); the intersection with these papers is minor, and it is worth noting that their analysis does not directly pertain to analysis of UCB and similar bandit algorithms. \n\nWe have noted the minor points raised as well, and will duly address them in the revision.

We greatly appreciate your feedback; point-wise responses to your main remarks are provided below.\n\n$(i)$ $Theorem1.$ Finite-time results are indeed well-known for UCB. However, the assertion that the optimal arm is played exponentially more often than the sub-optimal ones is true only when the instance is \"well-separated.\" In the context of the two-armed problem we study, a \"well-separated\" instance corresponds to a fixed value of $\\Delta$ that is bounded away from $0$ and independent of the horizon of play $n$ (basically, $\\Delta$ being some $positive$ absolute constant). Such an instance is an element of the \"large gap\" regime where $\\Delta = \\omega \\left( \\sqrt{{\\log n}/{n}} \\right)$. In the \"large gap\" regime, the finite-time behavior of the right tail of the distribution of $N_i(n)/n$ ($i$ being the inferior arm among the two) under UCB is well-documented in [5] (see the the literature review section of the main paper at Line 120). However, the results in [5] become vacuous if $\\Delta$ scales with $n$ and vanishes at $\\mathcal{O} \\left( \\sqrt{{\\log n}/{n}} \\right)$ rates. One of the technical contributions of our paper is deriving finite-time tail bounds for $N_i(n)/n$ in the $\\Delta = \\mathcal{O} \\left( \\sqrt{{\\log n}/{n}} \\right)$ regime. We derive and use such bounds in the proof of Theorem~1, but the details are currently included only in the supplementary material due to space constraints; we will revise the exposition of the main paper based on your suggestion.\n\n$(ii)$ $Theorem2.$ '$\\implies$' denotes weak convergence, as noted in Line 175. The proof sketch remarks that in the $q=1$ case, $N_1(n)$ is uniformly distributed over $\\{0,1,...,n\\}$ for any $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$. The assertion in part (II) of the theorem follows as a corollary to the aforementioned statement; to the best of our understanding there is no contradiction here. The full technical details can be found in Appendix~G.\n\n$(iii)$ $Theorem3.$ The result as stated is specific to the \"moderate gap\" regime where $\\Delta  \\asymp \\sqrt{{\\log n}/{n}}$. The proof sketch of Theorem~3 (Line 298-305) remarks that the limit of ${R_n^\\pi}/{\\sqrt{n\\log n}}$ is non-trivial only in the \"moderate gap\" regime. In other regimes of $\\Delta$, viz., $\\omega\\left( \\sqrt{{\\log n}/{n}} \\right)$ \"large\" and $o\\left( \\sqrt{{\\log n}/{n}} \\right)$ \"small\" gaps, the limit is $0$.\n\n$(iv)$ $Miscellaneous.$ We will place a greater emphasis on the practical implications of the phenomena of \"incomplete learning\" under Thompson Sampling and \"balanced sample-split\" under UCB; thank you for the suggestion. On your last point regarding \"incomplete learning,\" we do indeed believe that it is strongly tied to Thompson Sampling's better empirical (regret) performance vis-\\`a-vis UCB. Having said that, it seems far from obvious since the state-of-the-art minimax regret bounds in prior work are $\\mathcal{O}\\left( \\sqrt{n\\log n} \\right)$ for both algorithms. For UCB, our present work improves upon the state-of-the-art by showing an $\\Omega \\left( \\sqrt{n\\log n} \\right)$ lower bound; thus the minimax regret of UCB is, in fact, $\\Theta\\left( \\sqrt{n\\log n} \\right)$. For the version of Thompson Sampling studied in this paper (Beta priors and Bernoulli likelihoods), unfortunately, no lower bound on the minimax regret is currently known in the literature. As a result, despite compelling empirical evidence, the claim that Thompson Sampling incurs a smaller regret than UCB is still not theoretically supported. However, it is quite likely that the claim is true, considering well-known related results for the minimax regret of Thompson Sampling with Gaussian priors and Gaussian likelihoods, which is known to be $\\Theta\\left(\\sqrt{n}\\right)$ [2]. Furthermore, \"incomplete learning\" is also observable empirically under said algorithm. The same is true also for other minimax-optimal algorithms such as MOSS [Audibert and Bubeck, Minimax policies for adversarial and stochastic bandits, COLT 2009]; a minimax regret of $\\Theta\\left(\\sqrt{n}\\right)$ and an empirically observable \"incomplete learning\" phenomenon. We do believe based on these observations that the \"incomplete learning\" phenomenon for an algorithm is somehow connected to its minimax optimality. This also suggests that it may very well be possible to \"shave off\" the $\\sqrt{\\log n}$ term from the current state-of-the-art $\\mathcal{O}\\left( \\sqrt{n\\log n} \\right)$ bound for the Beta-Bernoulli version of Thompson Sampling studied in this paper. The theoretical development in this space, however, is in a very nascent stage at the moment, and much remains to be done to iron out these conjectures. We hope the present work helps build some foundations towards these future investigations. \n\nWe have noted other minor points raised as well, and will duly address them in the revision. Thank you again for the many helpful suggestions. "

With this characterization, focused on canonical UCB algorithm, they provides the first algorithm-specific worst case bound and the first diffusion-limit performance.\n  \nOriginality:\nTo the best of my knowledge, this is the first work to provide algorithm-specific result (Theorem 3). Also, it is interesting that they provide another view of proving the worst-case performance of UCB using a diffusion scaling approach (Theorem 4). Although the paper is not the first work introducing the diffusion scaling to bandit problems, it can deal with more standard bandit algorithms. As for the originality of proof of Theorem 4, proof techniques seem to be similar to that of [25]. Is there any difficulty to apply a diffusion scaling technique to more standard bandit algorithms?\n\nQuality:\nThe proposed theorems seem to be technically sound. The authors honestly discuss about the strengths and weaknesses.\n\nClarity:\nThe paper is well-written and provides appropriate examples. I can easily follow the motivation. Since the diffusion scaling is a key technique of the main contribution, more descriptions about it helps us to understand the details of the contributions.\n\nSignificance:\nAs written in the originality, the provided results are the first works, which is the significant point of the paper. Since the works include some limitations that deals with two-armed bandit settings, it is an important first step to explore other bandit algorithms and settings .\n A limitation of that paper is to deal with two-armed bandit settings, but as described in the concluding remarks in the paper, it may be generalized K-armed bandit. So, I think the contributions outweigh this drawback.\n\nI found the following researches that also consider the asymptotic regime using a diffusion approximation.

                "content": "The paper studies the asymptotical behaviors (with respect to the suboptimality gap $\\Delta$) of key statistics in the standard upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithm in standard multi-armed bandits (MAB). The contributions are as follows.\n\n1. The paper proves that the **asymptotical arm-sampling rate** converges to a constant, and gives its **analytical form** (Eq. 2). In particular, the paper discovers a non-trivial \"**moderate gap**\" regime for UCB. \n2. The paper proves an asymptotic regret lower bound for UCB **up to $(1 + o(1))$**  in two-armed bandits. \n3. The paper proves that the **asymptotical empirical sum** converges to a Brownian motion for UCB in two-armed bandits.\n4. The paper proves the asymptotical arm-sampling rate for Bernoulli Thompson sampling in two-armed *deterministic* bandits. \n5. The authors extend their results to MAB.  \nWhile asymptotical analyses are common in statisics and EE (e.g. mean-field asymptotics), it is not common in CS and rare in bandits literature. Asympotical analyses are important because it could help both researchers and practitioners better understand the algorithmic behaviors, because non-asymptotic analyses are usually not as exact and precise as their asymptotical counterparts. \n\nThis paper studies two-armed bandits, the classical and fundamental task in bandits literature, and analyzes UCB, the classical and fundamental algorithm in bandits literature. The most important statistics maintained by the UCB algorithm are the number of times of each arm being pulled and the empirical sum of each arm. For these two statistics, the paper provides exact asymptotical characterization under the simplest two-armed bandits case, which clearly distinguishes this paper from previous papers. The results are significant and set up seminal directions in bandits literature, and could benefit subsequent researchers, including myself. I believe the related works are cited adequately. \n\n\nThe paper is very well-written. The maths are easy to read and can be clearly verified in a step-by-step manner. I went through Appendices E and F (which contains main technical proofs) and did not find apparent errors. The authors are honest about their weakness about their results in the final section. \n\nThe paper almost completely depicts how standard UCB works in two-armed bandits. The results on other tasks such as multi-armed bandits and other algorithms such as Thompson sampling are, however, still premature. Further will be discussed in the limitations section. Nonetheless, given the novelty, quality, and clarity of this submission, I vote for a strong accept. \n### Limitations\n\n1. The authors' notations confuse me, in that it's not clear that *which limiting regime* the authors are discussing. It seems to me that Theorem 1 is stated for a sequence of two-armed bandits instances, i.e. for each $n$, there's an instance with parameters $(\\mu_{1, n}, \\mu_{2, n})$ such that $\\Delta_n = \\mu_{1, n} - \\mu_{2, n}$ satisfies $\\Delta_n \\asymp 1/\\sqrt{n}$, and that the $N_{i^*}(n) / n$ term in the result of Theorem 1 refers to the $N_{i^*}(n) / n$ in the $n$-th instance. The confusions exist at least for Theorem 1, 3, 4. Since asymptotical style results are not common in bandits literature, I recommend the authors to point out the asymptotical regime more clearly. \n2. The paper includes numerical experiments, so I think the section 3 in the checklist (Line 436) shall not be completed by \"N/A\", and the authors are encouraged to publish their codes, (though numerical experiments might be very simple).\n3. The paper fails to fully extend the results (Theorems 1, 3, 4) to the MAB case. The two-armed case is limited from both theoretical and practical perspective. In particular, in the two-armed case, the arm pulling rates satisfy $N_1(n) = n - N_2(n)$, which makes it possible to fully characterize the bandits by only analyzing one statistics $N_1(n)$. However, in the multi-armed case, at least two statistics need be studied. The paper did not prove the most intriguing \"moderate gap\" part in the multi-armed case.  \n4. The paper's results on Thompson sampling are quite limited, in that it only studies the deterministic case where rewards are constantly $0$ or $1$ for each arm. Although the authors somehow suggest that the results should extend to the stochastic setting by doing experiments (Fig. 1), I am still concerned about the results.  \n\n### Other Comments\n\n* Line 128: \"diffuion-limit\" should be \"diffusion-limit\"\n* Line 144-145: The sentence almost repeats the same sentence at Line 137-138, same thing at Line 149-150; the authors need not repeat the claim of first characeterization three times in the same paragraph\n\n### Societal Impact\n\nThe paper is mainly theoretical, and I don't see any potential negative societal impact."

Adding auxiliary losses to the main objective function is a general way of encoding biases that can help networks learn better representations. However, since auxiliary losses are minimized only on training data, they suffer from the same generalization gap as regular task losses. Moreover, by adding a term to the loss function, the model optimizes a different objective than the one we care about. In this work we address both problems: first, we take inspiration from transductive learning and note that after receiving an input but before making a prediction, we can fine-tune our networks on any unsupervised loss. We call this process tailoring, because we customize the model to each input to ensure our prediction satisfies the inductive bias. Second, we formulate meta-tailoring, a nested optimization similar to that in meta-learning, and train our models to perform well on the task objective after adapting them using an unsupervised loss. The advantages of tailoring and meta-tailoring are discussed theoretically and demonstrated empirically on a diverse set of examples.\n"

In this paper, we suggest tailoring losses serve a similar role to auxiliary losses, but better serve the outer objective and, in the experiments shown in the paper, work better. Intuitively, you want tailoring losses to be informative of the true task, so that the gradient minimizing the tailoring loss is aligned with the gradient minimizing the task loss (because at test time you can only see the former, but not the latter). This was analyzed for auxiliary losses [which are widely used] in [1].\n\nFinally, one notable point is that in meta-tailoring the network will be trained to perform well _after_ the update. Therefore, in the same way Figure 2 shows it doesn't overfit to the tailoring loss, if the tailoring loss is detrimental meta-tailoring is likely to ignore it.\n\nWe will add a comment (and pointer to [1]) in the main text.\n\n[1] Adapting auxiliary losses using gradient similarity; Du*,Czarnecki* et al.

This way the gap between training and inference distribution is removed that 'tailoring' introduces.  The paper describes a, to the best of my knowledge, novel method. I believe this method is interesting for niche applications of ML. The model is replaced by a short SGD loop of the model, such that given x a few iterations of SGD are performed, before making the prediction. I do not understand why there is no possibility to make the model behave straight away like the model after a few steps.\n\nMain Points:\n\n1. Method Description. The method is not described enough in the main paper. One has to read the appendix to really understand what the method is, especially for meta-tailoring. There should be pseudo-code or at least a more detailed text description in the main paper. For example, I do not understand what the difference of Meta-Tailoring (0 st.) is to the baseline, even after looking into the appendix. I am pretty confident that algorithm 1 would actually not train at all with steps=0. I also find the naming confusing with the introduction of CNGrad, but naming the application of CNGrad in the experiments Meta-tailoring again.\n\n2. First-order and detached CNGrad. You only consider detached CNGrad in all experiments (line. This is not the algorithm you provide guarantees for in Section 3. I think this is a severe short-coming, as the detached variant, also does not agree with the intuition one develops around meta-tailoring. For 2/4 experiments you write that you use first-order CNGrad, for the others it is not known. First-order CNGrad, goes even further away from meta-tailoring and detaches \\gamma and \\beta even earlier. This, thus makes the above problem even more severe.\n\n3. Focus. I think this paper could benefit a lot of a more focused structure. You try to keep everything as general as possible, but there you also have to make changes for each experiment. I believe the paper might benefit from more focus. Only considering one or two CNGrad variants with fixed hyper-parameters across tasks, a main evaluation on which you reach something close to state-of-the-art and more focus on the method presentation.\n\n4. Experiments. This paper proposes a broad method, thus I understand the motivation of the authors to include a diverse set of benchmarks. The problem with this setup is that, the evaluations themselves suffer from this. None, of the evaluations is described to a sufficient level, such that it is really hard to understand the effect.\n\n5. Baselines. The baselines are not easily understood. While, I very much appreciate that you add the tailoring loss to the inductive baseline for the first experiment, I am still a little critical regarding the baselines. You now put a lot of work in making CNGrad work including selecting where to apply CN layers, what inner-lr to use, whether to use first-order CNGrad or detached CNGrad, but for the baselines it seems you performed less of this tuning. For some of the baselines my feeling is that it is reasonably easy to come up with a way to make the inductive baseline perform well and consider the constraints at testing time. Like you wrote for Adverserial Examples.\n\n6. Costs. As this method introduces a considerable amount of extra gradient steps to the training loop, I believe there should be some considerations of the costs of this method in the main paper.\n\nSummary: The paper proposes an interesting new method. It does not show conclusive evidence that it improves state-of-the-art models in any domain, though, and it uses a different algorithm compared to the described algorithm. Additionally, parts of the paper seem to not be quite ready for a main conference and rather in a draft-stage. Nevertheless, I believe this paper might be a great contribution after some more work on the experiments and the presentation.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I did not take the time to read section 3 and the corresponding proofs in detail, as I do not believe that this changes my view of this paper too much, it is hard to follow and does, to my understanding, not apply to the algorithm actually used practically in the experiments as pointed out in 2.\n\nDetails:\n\ni) Line 720 'key' -> 'this is key'\n\nii) Line 105 '.

It\u2019s similar to saying a paper does meta-learning using FO-MAML[1]. In the same way, CNGrad is a meta-tailoring algorithm. \n\nYour observation about algorithm 1 is a great and subtle one; both options are correct! Taking a single outer step after all inner steps is similar to MAML[1].  Taking an outer step after every inner step is similar to WarpGrad[2], which got better results than MAML by having some weights $w$ trained in the outer loop and some weights $w\u2019$ trained in the inner loop. CNGrad builds on WarpGrad with the customization of the weights $w\u2019$ being CN layers, which allows the efficient parallelization. Preliminary experiments didn\u2019t show much difference between both approaches (MAML-like vs. WarpGrad-like). Therefore, we chose the latter for consistency. \n\n**Math applies to all the experiments**: we want to emphasize that section 3 does apply to all the experiments. As described in theorem 1, it applies to any meta-tailoring algorithm (where the prediction function is the same for test and train). Theorem 1 and Remark 1 provide upper-bounds of the test task loss that depend on $\\mathcal{L}^{tailor}(x,\\theta_{x,S})$. The same bounds apply to regular inductive learning algorithms by just changing $\\theta_{x,S}$ to $\\theta_S$. The key insight then is that meta-tailoring algorithms can optimize $\\mathcal{L}^{tailor}(x,\\theta_{x,S})$ for each $x$ at prediction time, lowering the upper-bound.  Because all experiments use meta-tailoring, they are all within the scope of the theory results.\n\n**Clarity** Thank you for all your questions and comments.

Updating the BatchNorm parameters during training for each example yields a neural network that generalizes better even without these updates.\n\nCNGrad vs meta-tailoring: It seems to only be a communication problem, e.g. in the contrastive learning experiments you don't do CNGrad, but aren't explicit about it.

Shouldn't you only take one final step with $w$, and $steps$ many steps with $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ only?\n\nThe Math: I believe the math of the method you do not even use has too big a part of this paper.

                "content": " Thank you for the detailed review and constructive comments.\n\n**Clarifications on 0-step meta-tailoring** We agree that the notation was confusing; we will clarify it. The number of steps within the parentheses of table 1 corresponds only to the number of inner steps taken at test time. For meta-tailoring, we performed 2 inner steps during training and then analyzed the performance of varying the test-time inner steps. This analysis is common for gradient-based meta-learning algorithms, where we meta-train with a fixed number of inner steps and observe how performance evolves w.r.t. the number of meta-test inner steps. In table 1, 0-step meta-tailoring refers to the case where we perform 0 inner steps at test time, but have performed 2 inner steps at training time. We will clarify this in the main text.\n\n**Devoting more space to algorithm, experiments and compute costs** We agree that more detail in the method section and the experiments would be fruitful. Given the amount of theoretical content and number of experiments, we had to move many details to the appendix, as well as an entire toy-but-insightful experiment (appendix H). We are considering moving other subsections to the appendix to increase the details in the method and experiments sections. In particular, we will summarize the relationship between meta-tailoring and meta-learning on page 3 and the broader impact statement. We welcome other suggestions!\nWith respect to computational costs, note that we discuss them in section 6.2 in the main text, with extra details in lines 725-738 in appendix D. We will move some of these details to the main text.\n\n**CNGrad vs meta-tailoring** Meta-tailoring computes a different set of weights for each example. In PyTorch and TensorFlow, we cannot parallelize this process in the general case (it is possible to do it in JAX). CNGrad allows us to parallelize meta-tailoring in all these platforms, by only customizing the conditional normalization layers to each example. Tailoring and meta-tailoring are the frameworks, CNGrad is an architectural trick to make them efficient. This is why we simultaneously refer to meta-tailoring and CNGrad in our experiments. We will make it clearer in the text.\n\n**First-order CNGrad** The reviewer correctly points out that all results come from first-order CNGrad (which is the same as detached CNGrad). However, note that we also tried CNGrad\u2019s  second-order version for the first experiment, which actually performed slightly worse. This was not entirely surprising for the following reasons:\nAs observed in the meta-learning literature, second-order gradients are often unstable, requiring us to use a smaller inner learning rate.\nAs in the case of FO-MAML[1] or REPTILE[2] for meta-learning, first-order CNGrad does not warp the inner optimization but still takes the adaptation into account. Therefore it still satisfies the essence of meta-tailoring captured in the theory section(#3).\nFirst-order versions have proven successful in meta-learning[1,2]. In meta-tailoring, all networks tackle the same task. Therefore, we expect the differences between the tailored weights of each example to be smaller than the differences between the adapted weights of different tasks in meta-learning. Since the second-order part of the optimization concerns itself with these small differences between examples, the importance of second-order gradients in meta-tailoring will be even smaller than in meta-learning.\nGiven their similar performance, we used the first-order version of CNGrad because it is easier to implement and faster. An in-depth comparison between both options can be found in lines 693-710 in appendix D.\n\n**Varying hyper-parameters and strength of the baselines** The reviewer rightfully points out that meta-tailoring with CNGrad adds hyper-parameters: number of inner steps, inner learning rate, and whether to use first-order or second-order optimization in CNGrad. However, this doesn\u2019t result in stronger hyperparameter tuning w.r.t the baselines for the following reasons:\n- **Good baseline tuning**: all but four baselines come from impactful published works, which were optimized by their corresponding authors. We took great care with the remaining four baselines implemented by us. We thank the reviewer for noticing that we appropriately tuned the corresponding hyperparameter for the two inductive baselines in the physics experiment. In that experiment, we also allowed the TTT baseline to do the inner loop up to convergence. This used 5 times more steps than meta-tailoring (the more steps the better for both methods, as seen in table 1 and figure 2). Finally, for the TTT baseline for the contrastive learning experiments we searched over steps and learning rate in the exact same way as for meta-tailoring (this tuning is shown in figure 5 in appendix G).\n- **Monotonic dependence w.r.t. hyperparameters**: as long as the optimization is stable (which can be easily checked during training) we observe a mostly monotonic relationship between the final task loss and the three hyper-parameters. A higher learning rate is better, more steps are better, and second-order is better than first-order. Increasing the inner learning rate eventually resulted in instabilities, both the steps and second-order CNGrad increase compute, and the second-order CNGrad increased code complexity. Since we were not seeking the state-of-the-art, we always used the first-order version and a small number of steps to reduce compute and code complexity. Using more steps or the second-order version could have improved results further.\n- **Diversity of experiments results in varied hyperparameters**: all experiments use first-order CNGrad. The reviewer is correct in mentioning that the number of steps and inner learning rate vary across experiments. This is because this paper includes a wide diversity of applications. Some networks are very small (3-layers) and some are large (ResNet-50 in the contrastive and adversarial experiments). Having a small network allows having a larger number of steps. Similarly, losses also vary greatly: some are MSE and some are cross-entropy, with varied scales. These different magnitudes affect the range of effective inner learning rates.\n\n\n[1] Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks; Finn et al. \u201817\n\n[2] On First-Order Meta-Learning Algorithms; Nichol et al. \u201818"

It is worth noting that we chose to build on some of the most impactful papers in contrastive learning, certified adversarial examples, and physics modeling to facilitate understanding instead of using the state-of-the-art works, which often have more bells and whistles. Moreover, all three are still close to SOA in their respective fields. We also chose to focus on the same-distribution setting, where our theoretical guarantees apply, to keep the message clear and consistent. \n\n**Practical implementation in deep learning frameworks** Both tailoring and meta-tailoring are already efficiently implementable in JAX. This is because JAX allows the evaluation of multiple networks with the same architecture but different weights in a batch. To the best of our knowledge, this is not yet possible in PyTorch and TensorFlow. For these frameworks, we constructed CNGrad, where parameter updates only occur in conditional normalization layers, which can be efficiently parallelized. Therefore, CNGrad can be efficiently deployed in all popular deep learning frameworks. We will clarify this in the text."

                "content": " **Avoiding catastrophic forgetting** Partial catastrophic forgetting of the task loss can occur when doing tailoring with a large learning rate or for many inner steps. However, it does not occur when doing meta-tailoring. This can be seen in figure 2. The green curve (representing tailoring) begins at the top right and, at first, goes down and to the left: as we minimize the physics tailoring loss, the task loss also decreases. However, as you mention, the task loss eventually starts to increase after many inner steps. Therefore, tailoring is mostly useful for a few inner steps (which will also be faster). In the case of meta-tailoring, catastrophic forgetting is not a problem because meta-tailoring takes the tailoring process into account during training. There, the model is trained to have a low task loss after the tailoring update and thus learns not to forget about the task loss after the inner optimization. You can see that in the monotonicity of the blue curve.\n\n**Relation to semi-supervised learning** We agree about the relevance of the semi-supervised learning literature and virtual adversarial training. We will add more discussion on both topics. It is worth noting that transductive learning (which we list as one of our main inspirations) is closely related to semi-supervised learning, as it assumes unlabeled test data is available at training time. We will clarify this relationship in the paper; following the great analysis of chapters 24&25 in [1].\n\n**Tailoring with pseudo-labels** Allowing the model to make an initial prediction, then tailoring the model to maximize its confidence makes a lot of sense. In particular, minimizing entropy at the test points was the main loss used in the classic transductive learning literature. Your idea would be to bring this loss to the meta-tailoring setting, which is likely to be useful!\n\n[1] Semi-Supervised Learning; Chapelle, Scholkopf, Zien"

Tailoring provides a different perspective that avoids involving extra loss function in the proxy fashion.  Besides, the authors proposed meta-tailoring, which integrates the unsupervised loss in a way similar to meta-learning. The theoretical discussion and empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed tailoring.   Strengths:\n1. The idea of tailoring is interesting. The current neural networks mainly conduct amortized optimization, how to reduce such gap especially on the test data is an important research direction. I believe the proposed framework could provide a different perspective on understanding the \"generalization\" gap and different inductive biases. \n\n2. The limitation of tailoring lies in the increased computational cost. To reduce such extra cost, the authors thus introduce CNGRAD which could efficiently parallel the evaluation of the model over multiple samples.  And there is detailed and sound theoretical justification on the CNGRAD provided. \n\n3. The authors provided extensive examples of inductive biases. And correspondingly the experiment results on symmetry constraints, inductive biases, contrastive loss, and adversarial examples justify the effectiveness of both tailoring and meta-tailoring.  The ablation study is well designed and the results are promising.\n\nWeakness:\n1. One particular concern of mine is when conducting tailoring the parameters of the model change according to a single sample, this is similar to the continual learning setting. I wonder how the methods could avoid catastrophic forgetting. It seems that the authors constrain the steps of the tailoring while small changes in parameter space could result in the relatively large change of the model output. I suggest the authors add more discussions on this part. \n\n2. Though the method does no limit the application scenarios, I feel that the method is highly related to the field of semi-supervised learning. Therefore, I suggest more discussions on the related works. For example, the adversarial examples setting of tailoring is related the virtual adversarial learning in semi-supervised learning [1].\n\n[1].

Although the experiments are quite limited overall, the paper is a good addition for the ML community.   The paper introduces tailoring and meta tailoring as a means to add inductive biases at test-time using contrastive losses. The paper overcomes some of the shortcomings of TTT and meta-tailoring seems like an interesting improvement over TTT. The idea of encouraging soft inductive biases (5.2) is very interesting and practical. I would like the authors to include experiments such as domain generalization (like the sort done by TTT) since I believe that those set of experiments are very good tests of how such algorithms can adapt to novel data distributions (not just adversarial samples as they are a very specific type of generalization. Although the authors mention the practical problems with implementation in popular deep learning frameworks (pytorch and tensorflow), it would be good for the authors to provide means to overcome such problems so that CNGrad can become a staple in the deployment of ML models.\n\nThe authors tend to focus on the breadth of results to show the generality of the solution, rather than depth in one or two fields, it might be useful to show more difficult tasks in any of the tasks to show a strict improvement and the scalability of the solution. The most practical problems with the frameworks (as the authors discuss) is with privacy as the models are \"tailored\" for the given example.

The authors claim that this method can improve robustness, as well as improve train-test generalization gap in cases where there is a known inductive prior on the expected output (e.g. when modelling physical systems)\n  The paper's writing could be improved, as the writing is complex and hard to follow. Furthermore the model details were mixed with the introduction, making it hard to understand what is the author's proposed work. It is also hard to understand the implementation details of this idea, as the authors share neither pseudo-code nor actual code to illustrate their implementation.

The authors evaluate their method and baselines along both accuracy and speed metrics and provide extensive additional experiments in their supplement. However, some reviewers have raised concerns about the scope, quality, and significance of the study.\n\nReviewer 1 suggests that the authors describe an interesting method for quickly identifying risk scores in a diverse range of settings, but questions the usefulness of the speed improvement in real-world offline settings. They also mention that the authors do not consider societal impact, which is an important factor given the suggested use cases. Additionally, they find the figure displaying the speed and accuracy trade-off frustrating, as it doesn't allow for a proper assessment of the baseline method's scaling.\n\nReviewer 2 points out that the authors' algorithm often produces a pool of solutions, but the number of solutions produced and their differences from each other are not discussed. They also raise concerns about the potential negative societal impacts of the approach, which the authors have not addressed.\n\nReviewer 3 describes the proposed method as novel and efficient, achieving SOTA performance with less time cost in some datasets. However, they also note that the examples of scoring systems in the introduction are outdated, and there is little discussion of the traditional framework of scoring systems and their differences in methodology and performance with the proposed method. Additionally, they suggest that the model AUC should be assessed for consistency between predicted scores and actual risk, and the feasibility of the generated scoring system should be discussed.\n\nReviewer 4 raises several methodological concerns, such as the choice of hyperparameters, the tolerance gap level, and the discussion of alternative approaches. They also suggest that the authors make use of the pool of \"equally good\" scores to help users balance performance and fairness.\n\nOverall, the reviewers have provided valuable feedback on the manuscript, highlighting both its strengths and weaknesses. While the method proposed in the paper shows promise, the reviewers have raised important concerns that need to be addressed before it can be widely adopted.

Risk scores are sparse linear models with integer coefficients; often these models can be memorized or placed on an index card. Typically, risk scores have been created either without data or by rounding logistic regression coefficients, but these methods do not reliably produce high-quality risk scores. Recent work used mathematical programming, which is computationally slow. We introduce an approach for efficiently producing a collection of high-quality risk scores learned from data. Specifically, our approach  produces a pool of almost-optimal sparse continuous solutions, each with a different support set, using a beam-search algorithm. Each of these continuous solutions is transformed into a separate risk score through a \"star ray\" search, where a range of multipliers are considered before rounding the coefficients sequentially to maintain low logistic loss. Our algorithm returns all of these high-quality risk scores for the user to consider. This method completes within minutes and can be valuable in a broad variety of applications. "

Ideally, domain knowledge should be integrated into the scoring system as early as possible. Moreover, the \"best model\" might not be the most suitable model/solution in clinical practice.

We haven\u2019t done it yet for two reasons: (1) we didn\u2019t have enough time since we were asked to perform a huge number of experiments during the short rebuttal phase and we didn't have enough time to crush it all carefully into NeurIPS' 9 page limit, and (2) we thought it would be helpful for reviewers if we kept the original main paper and appendix while providing only a new Section G titled ''Reviewer-requested Extra Experiments and Discussion'' (Page 43-69). The reason for this arrangement is that we thought the reviewers might want to compare the originally submitted results and newly requested results in Section G. \n\nWith regards to the remaining concern on running time in the last reply, please see a new plot in Figure 40 under Appendix G.7. We think the replacement of Figure 4 with the new ones we propose in the appendix should do it. Just to recap: we have included new time results (time limit is 1h) in Figure 40 in Section G.7. Figure 4 and 7 in the original submission already shows that FasterRisk can finish running at most 5 minutes while RiskSLIM runs on most folds and datasets for 15 minutes (which was the original time limit) without finishing. In Figure 40 (page 70 in the appendix), we raised the time limit for RiskSLIM up to 1 hour. Most of the folds and datasets still do not finish. Therefore, using the 1-hour results of RiskSLIM show that FasterRisk has an even more impressive speed advantage. We also discussed in our earlier rebuttal about the necessity of faster run times - interactions with humans should be able to be done in real-time, not waiting over an hour between runs.\n\nWe believe all your technical comments were addressed in our rebuttal and in the new Appendix G for reviewers.

Creating sparse continuous solutions as in Section 3.1 and 3.2 are intermediate milestones towards this goal. So we do this too.\n    \n2. $\\textbf{Are there any possible large error accumulation?}$ Not according to our experiments. We don't lose error at any step so error doesn't accumulate.\n    \n3. $\\textbf{How to understand the multiplier $m$?}$ When we do StarRaySearch in Algorithm 3, we shrink the feature matrix by $m$ and $\\textit{multiply}$ the coefficients by $m$ (therefore the name ''multiplier''). When we calculate the risk probability, because the scores are based on the original features instead of shrunk features, we have to divide the total score by this multiplier $m$ to get the right probability.\n    \n4. $\\textbf{Can you comment on swapping one feature at a time is computationally efficient?}$ Actually, swapping one feature for another is efficient. If you consider swapping 2 features, there are ${k \\choose 2}$ choices, where $k$ is the number of nonzero features. 3 features requires you to choose among $\\binom{k}{3}$ features. It is $\\textit{much}$ computationally easier just to enumerate $k$ options for swapping.\n    \n5. $\\textbf{What is the range of multiplier?}$ This has already been specified in Line 2 in Algorithm 3. We re-state here in words: if all coefficients have magnitude all less than 5, we want to stretch the coefficients with a multiplier. The largest value for the multiplier is $m_{max} = 5/max |w|$ because we want the coefficients to stay within the box constraints. The smallest multiplier is $m_{min}=1$. If some coefficients are already on the boundary of the box constraints (either +5 or -5), we explore shrinking the coefficients by a multiplier. We choose the smallest multiplier to be $m_{min}=0.5$ and the largest multiplier to be $m_{max}=1$. We pick $N_m$ (default value is 20) equally spaced multiplier values from the interval $[m_{min}, m_{max}]$. We have done perturbation study on this hyperparameter $N_m$ during rebuttal.

                "content": " 1. $\\textbf{Is the competitor RiskSLIM being slow concerning in practical applications?}$ Yes! Speed is very important in these settings: (1) When we cannot compute the answer at all using the slow method because it does not scale to reasonably-sized datasets. It could take over a week to compute the solution for even reasonably small datasets. (2) Interactive machine learning. Machine learning in the wild is essentially never a single run of an algorithm. Often times, the users want to explore the data and adjust various constraints along the way as they get more familiar with possible models. Fast speed allows users to go through this iteration process many times without interruptions (of several days perhaps) for the algorithm to run. This is where FasterRisk will be very useful in high stakes offline settings. This is because after the pool of models is generated within 5 minutes, interacting with the pool is essentially instantaneous, allowing users to interact with it. Please see  Appendix G1 (in the new appendix for reviewers, Appendix G).\n    \n2. $\\textbf{Are there datasets where our method FasterRisk has significant performance (solution quality) advantage?}$ Yes! Please see Figure 5 (Appendix E1) and Figure 6 (Appendix E2). These three datasets have high dimensional features and feature correlation is also very high (See Table 2 in Appendix D1 for data set information), which make them challenging. Our method FasterRisk significantly outperforms other baselines in AUC. Additionally, please look at Figure 11 in Appendix E5 and Figures 18-21 in Appendix G1 for the logistic loss curves on the training set. FasterRisk achieves much lower logistic loss than RiskSLIM.\n    \n3. $\\textbf{Can you clarify some mathematical notations?}$\n\n    3.1. $\\epsilon_{w^*}$ in Eq 4 is a user-defined value for the gap tolerance level corresponding to the optimal solution $w^*$. If we set $\\epsilon_{w^*}$ too close to 0, we may not find any solutions (since it is NP-hard to find the optimal solution); if we set $\\epsilon_{w^*}$ too large, we could find too many solutions to evaluate and some solutions are not as good quality.\n\n    3.2. $\\epsilon_{t}$ in Eq 5 is any arbitrary value that makes Eq 5 hold. We can think of $\\epsilon_{t}$ as the loss difference between the rounded integer solution $\\{w^{+t}, w_0^{+t}\\}$ and original continuous solution $\\{w^{t}, w_0^{t}\\}$.\n\n    3.3. In Eq 6, $d$ is the coefficient on coordinate $j$. $\\textbf{e}$${}_j$ is a unit vector with 1 on coordinate $j$ and 0 on other coordinates.\n\n    3.4. In Eq 7, $c_{d_j}$ is already defined in Line 182. It is the coefficient on coordiante $j$ after one step of coordinate descent.\n\n    3.5. In Eq 8, you can think of $a$ and $b$ as coefficients and intercept. We try to avoid using $w, w_0$ here because they appear on the left.\n\n    3.6. In Eq 9, you can think of $a$ as the coefficient on coordinate $j$.\n    \n4. $\\textbf{Can we compare with AutoScore?}$ Thank you for providing this paper. We have cited this in Line 394. Please see Figure 25-27 in Appendix G3 for the comparison between AutoScore, RiskSLIM, and FasterRisk. FasterRisk outperforms AutoScore in all cases.\n    \n    We are solving a more challenging optimization problem than AutoScore because AutoScore does not impose the box constraints on the coefficients during feature selection. We want scores to be small (in one digit) so that ordinary people can add/subtract numbers in their heads.\n    \n    The philosophy of these two approaches is different. AutoScore is designed to involve the user in the optimization process. In contrast, FasterRisk solves the optimization automatically and engages the user only in selecting the best model. Our method FasterRisk is complementary to AutoScore's random forest-based feature selection approach; one can apply FasterRisk for feature selection by using our beam search method. Again, please see Figure 25-27 in Appendix G3 for the comparison between AutoScore, RiskSLIM, and FasterRisk.\n    \n5. $\\textbf{Can we show results for other $\\epsilon$ values for the diverse pool?}$ Please see Figure 31-33 in Appendix G4.2.\n    \n6. $\\textbf{Can we show other empirical results regarding change in other hyperparameters?}$ In Figure 28-30 in Appendix G4.1, we changed the beam size hyperparameter; in Figure 34-36 in Appendix G4.3, we changed the number of attempts hyperparameter; in Figure 37-39 in Appendix G4.4, we changed the number of multipliers hyperparameter.\n    \n7. $\\textbf{Can we show examples from the pool of solutions?}$ Yes! Please see Tables 30-41 in Appendix G5 for 12 models from the pool.\n    \n8. $\\textbf{Add to the Checklist. Is there insufficient discussion of fairness?}$ Good point. We added a discussion in the checklist to say that even if a model is interpretable, it could still have negative societal bias, and looking at a variety of models from the pool could help find models that are more fair.\n\nThank you so much for your review!"

Please see the experiments and discussions in the new Appendix G1.\n    \n4. $\\textbf{Is performance improvement significant?}$ The timing improvement is orders of magnitude smaller, which is the most important. RiskSLIM is guaranteed to produce optimal solutions (with respect to its search space) eventually, so we don't expect to always achieve a performance improvement with respect to it. However, since our search space is larger, we often see a performance improvement that is significant, especially on the three extra datasets in the Appendix. Please see Figure 5 (Appendix E1) and Figure 6 (Appendix E2). Additionally, please look at Figure 11 in Appendix E5 and Figures 18-21 in Appendix G1 for the logistic loss curves on the training set. FasterRisk achieves better logistic losses than RiskSLIM.\n    \n5. $\\textbf{Can we provide calibration curves?}$ Yes! Please see Figure 22-24 in Appendix G2.\n    \n6. $\\textbf{Can we prove the feasibility of the generated scoring system?}$ All scoring systems satisfy the constraints and are thus feasible.

                "content": " 1. $\\textbf{Why is speed improvement important?}$ Speed is very important in these settings: (1) when we cannot compute the answer at all using the slow method because it does not scale to reasonably-sized datasets. It could take over a week to compute the solution for even reasonably small datasets. (2) Interactive design of models. Machine learning in the wild is generally never a single run of an algorithm. Often times, the users want to explore the data and adjust various constraints along the way as they get more familiar with possible models. Fast speed allows users to go through this iteration process many times without interruptions (of several days perhaps) for the algorithm to run. This is where FasterRisk will be very useful in high stakes offline settings. This is because after the pool of models is generated within 5 minutes, interacting with the pool is essentially instantaneous, allowing users to interact with it.\n    \n2. $\\textbf{Are there datasets where there are some significant differences (beyond 2 percent) in AUC between FasterRisk and alternative methods?}$ Please see Figure 5 (Appendix E1) and Figure 6 (Appendix E2). These three datasets have high dimensional features and feature correlation is also very high (See Table 2 in Appendix D1 for data set information), which makes them challenging. Our method FasterRisk significantly outperforms other baselines in AUC. Additionally, please look at Figure 11 in Appendix E5 and Figures 18-21 in Appendix G1 for the logistic loss curves on the training set. FasterRisk is doing a much better optimization job than RiskSLIM because it can use a larger search space.\n    \n3. $\\textbf{What happens when we run the baseline RiskSlim longer?}$ We added an experiment in Figures 18-21 in Appendix G1.1 and G1.2. When we run RiskSLIM for 1 hour, FasterRisk still outperforms RiskSLIM; when we run RiskSLIM longer for 4 days, FasterRisk outperforms RiskSLIM on 7 out of 9 datasets except on Mushroom and Spambase. (In the two remaining cases, the results are essentially tied.) \n    \n4. $\\textbf{Can we share the number of rows and columns in each data set?}$ Yes, the dataset information is already shown in Table 2 of Appendix D1.\n    \n5. $\\textbf{How were scoring system examples selected in section 4.3?}$ They were selected from the diverse pool based on the smallest logistic loss on the training set. It is in exactly the same manner as detailed in Line 253-254 for the pooled-PLR baselines.\n    \n6. $\\textbf{Is interpretability unique to our approach?}$ No, all methods that produce risk scores are interpretable. This includes our approach and the baselines we compared with. \n    \n7. $\\textbf{Can I see pool of solutions?}$ Sure! We have included several large tables in Appendix G5 in Table 30-41 of 12 models from the pool.\n    \n8. $\\textbf{Do we expect users to look through all solutions in a pool or only the best one with the lowest error?}$ Ideally a user-interface would help guide the user from the lowest-error model to one that would best suit their needs. Error is generally not the only criteria users would consider when deciding to implement a model. Our contribution here is just to design the algorithm for finding these models, but we plan to develop this interface next. The user could also simply rank the models from the smallest to the largest error and choose one.\n    \n9. $\\textbf{Why do we answer ``N/A'' for the checklist question about any negative societal impacts?}$ The reviewer makes an excellent point. We have edited this in the checklist to say that even if a model is interpretable, it can still have negative societal bias (though it is easier to check for such biases with scoring systems), and looking at a variety of models from the pool could help find models that are more fair. We placed this information into Appendix G, which is the new appendix for reviewers.\n\nThank you so much for your review!"

                "content": " The authors propose a method for efficiently automatically generating a pool of \u201crisk scores\u201d (sparse linear models with integer coefficients), involving (1) a beam search algorithm to identify a sparse set of features, (2) given the original set of features, identify a pool of sparse solutions with similar performance (but \u201cdiverse\u201d set of features), and (3) \u201cstar ray\u201d search to choose integer coefficients. They evaluate both the speed and accuracy of their approach on multiple benchmark datasets.  The authors describe an interesting method for quickly identifying risk scores in a diverse range of settings. The main improvement seems to be speed (which wasn\u2019t very well quantified with respect to baselines), since performance-wise  it was similar to a previous approach \u2013 and I wonder how useful this speed would actually be in this high-stakes offline setting. \n\nOriginality/clarity: this seems to be a creative combination of past algorithms, and they described their algorithms in detail\n\nQuality/significance: the authors evaluated their methods and baselines along both accuracy and speed metrics, and also shared extensive additional experiments in their supplement. One aspect that seemed problematic was that for speed plots, they cut off algorithms after 15 minutes, and it\u2019s unclear exactly how their baselines scale because they tend to be censored after just one or two points along the x-axis. It would also be helpful to see if quantitatively, there are any significant differences in AUC between FasterRisk and alternative methods. Based on these two results, it would be easier to assess whether their method provides a meaningful contribution to real-world use cases of risk scores.\n\nThe authors also do not describe any considerations of societal impact which is an important factor given their suggested use cases. \n - You mention  (line 54)  \u201cWe need an approach that exhibits the best of both worlds: speed fast enough to operate in a few  minutes on a laptop and optimization and search capability as powerful as that of the mathematical programming tools. Our method, FasterRisk, lies at this intersection.\u201d \u2014 Of course, it makes sense to have a goal of developing an accurate model, but I\u2019m wondering why it is important that risk scores must operate in a few minutes on a laptop. If these are risk scores for a high-impact situation, why can\u2019t we run an analysis for an hour? Or even a week? \n\n- Figure 4:   I find this figure a bit frustrating, because it\u2019s not really allowing me to see how the baseline method scales compared to yours.  A 15 minute time-out seems kind of silly/arbitrary (in the real world, I\u2019d expect people to be willing to train their methods for quite a while if it\u2019s for a high stakes setting), and I would highly recommend allowing your baselines to run for longer (at least several hours) to show how the times actually scale (and then possibly display with a log scale as needed). It would also be helpful to share the number of rows and columns in each of the datasets to give a sense of scale. \n\n- Section 4.3 Example scoring systems: how were these examples selected?   Also, you mention that risk scores offer interpretability \u2013 is this something that you argue is unique to your approach and not your baselines?\n\n- Your algorithm is often described to return a \u201cpool\u201d of solutions, but I didn\u2019t see much discussion of what  that pool actually looks like. For example, I would want to see how many solutions were produced, how different they are from each other, etc.   In a use case, would you expect the user to look through all of them and then choose one, or just defer to the lowest-error one?\n The authors describe some limitations related to their algorithms, which is appreciated. However, they describe the potential negative societal impacts as \u201c[N/A]\u201d which seems like a huge oversight to me. As they say, \u201c[risk scores] are possibly the most popular form of predictive model for high stakes decisions through the last century and are the standard form of model used in criminal justice  and medicine,\u201d it seems obvious that any contribution they make to this field could have serious societal impacts, for better or worse.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of how this approach could be used problematically:  Let\u2019s say we have a criminal justice scenario in which we have access to race and some other features that are essentially proxies for race (e.g., zip code). \tNow let\u2019s assume a user is given a pool of \u201cdiverse\u201d solutions by the FasterRisk approach, and they know that they don\u2019t want a model that\u2019s \u201cracist\u201d. They may notice one risk score has a highest accuracy but relies on race, so they decide they shouldn\u2019t use that model. They then notice an almost identical model that has all the same features except race has been replaced by zip code, and they choose this model instead and deploy it in some real world scenario (e.g., recommending whether someone should be placed on parole).\n"

Additionally, using some tables to directly show the key improvements may be more intuitive and detailed. \n3.\tAlthough extensive experiments and discussion on performance, in my opinion, its most significant improvement would be efficiency, and there are few discussions or ablation experiments on efficiency. \n4.\tThe model AUC can assess the model discriminant ability, i.e., the probability of a positive case is bigger than that of a negative case, but may be hard to show its consistency between predicted score and actual risk. However, this consistency may be more crucial to the clinical scoring system (differentiated with classification task). Therefore, the related studies are encouraged to conduct calibration curves to show the agreement. It would be better to prove the feasibility of the generated scoring system?

                "content": " This paper aims to provide a fast algorithm to derive sparse risk scores that scales to high-dimensional datasets. The authors identified a few major limitations in current methods, and described how these were addressed by the three components in their proposed algorithm. In several experiments with low and high dimension data, the authors showed that their method outperformed the current state-of-the-art and several other baseline methods. The algorithm is implemented in stand-alone Python code, which is advantageous over competitors that rely on mathematical programming solvers. This paper describes the authors\u2019 original work to resolve several methodological difficulties in current development of risk scores. The writing is clear in defining several major challenges the authors aimed to address, and the proposed algorithm consists of separate components to address them. In addition to evaluating the algorithm with respect to baselines, the authors also showed the importance of each component by assessing the reduction in performance without them.\n\nMy major concern is the scope of this study, which affects its quality and significance. The authors aim to develop a fast and well-performing algorithm, FasterRisk, to develop sparse risk scores, which, if successful, would be very useful to healthcare applications. But when discussing related work, the authors did not include some recent works that have partially addressed some of the limitations the authors proposed to address (elaborated in Question 1 below). When evaluating FasterRisk, there is practically only one competitor algorithm, and FasterRisk only had marginal advantage in performance (in most experiments). FasterRisk is indeed much faster than the competitor, but by timing out the run time at 15 minutes, I am not convinced that the competitor is slow enough to be concerning in practice.\n\nThe clarity in mathematics notations can be improved. The equations became difficult to follow when the author used some notations without introducing them. For example, $\\{epsilon}_w$ in equation (4) and $\\{epsilon}_t$ in equation (5) lack bounds, and it is difficult to understand what the arbitrary a, b, c, d, e in equations (6)-(9) stand for. These affect my trust in the work.\n 1. The authors focused on developing scores by finding integer sparse solutions, and showed some advantages of FasterRisk over the state-of-the-art. But I find the discussion of alternative approaches inadequate, therefore I could not fully appreciate the contribution of this work. For example, the authors pointed out two major limitations of building scores by rounding logistic regression coefficients: (i) $l_1$ and $l_0$ regularizations not able to get sparse solutions, and (ii) rounding of coefficients worsens performance by making the scores too coarse. But (i) may be resolved by using alternative variable selection methods and (ii) by using smallest non-zero coefficient to scale all coefficients and then rounding to larger integer values (e.g., total score ranging from 0 to 100). For example, a 2020 paper (https://doi.org/10.2196/21798) describes such an alternative approach that worked reasonably well in several clinical applications, and by separating variable selection from score development, domain experts are more easily engaged in the development process to ensure clinical meaningfulness and fairness. I find this paper lacking in discussion on this general approach. Could the authors include such more recent works in their discussion and method evaluation?\n\n2. The authors stated in appendix that the choice of hyperparameters does not have much impact on performance, but did not provide empirical evidence. I am particularly concerned with the choice of tolerance gap level $\\{epsilon}=0.3$ (equation (9)), meaning we are willing to tolerate up to 30% increase in loss when expanding to \u201cequally good\u201d scores. Without detailed explanation, 30% seems too large to me. Can the authors justify their choice empirically or by citing related literature? I would also like to see some empirical results regarding change in other hyperparameters.\n\n3. Although the authors generated a pool of \u201cequally good\u201d scores, they did not seem to make use of them other than selecting the best-performing one to report. This pool of scores could be useful for users to select well-performing AND fair scores. This is related to Limitations below. Fairness of scores developed from the proposed algorithm is not adequately discussed. Related to Question 3 above, a na\u00efve application of the proposed method may lead to unfair risk scores. For example, in Table 3 of Appendix F, the method generated a 3-variable risk score to predict salary>30K using education level and marital status, and this direct link of being married with salary level is highly debatable. Marital status might represent a mixed effect of age and socio-economic status, and it may be better to use the latter in the score for more meaningful interpretation. Since the authors have generated a pool of \u201cequally good\u201d scores that make use of alternative predictors in a step of the algorithm, I suggest the authors make use of this pool to help users balance performance and fairness."

This urgency gives rise to the need to make QA systems robust to misinformation, a topic previously unexplored. We study the risk of misinformation to QA models by investigating the behavior of the QA model under contradicting contexts that are mixed with both real and fake information. We create the first large-scale dataset for this problem, namely ContraQA, which contains over 10K human-written and model-generated contradicting pairs of contexts. Experiments show that QA models are vulnerable under contradicting contexts brought by misinformation. To defend against such a threat, we build a misinformation-aware QA system as a counter-measure that integrates question answering and misinformation detection in a joint fashion. "

                "content": "This paper addresses the problem of deriving the correct answer when contradicting examples are presented to the model. First, it introduces a dataset for the task. The dataset, ContraQA is built on SQuAD, and it contains contradicting contexts produced by humans and neural-models. Then, it presents a model for generating contradicting examples. The model, BART-FG, generates fake contexts by iteratively modifying and original input paragraph. The procedure starts by applying a constituency parsing to extract constituency spans from the input sentence. Then, it randomly masks some of these constituency spans, that are eventually fill by a BART model fine-tuned on Wikipedia dump. To study how QA models behave with contradicting examples, this work evaluates the performances in a scenario where the correct and the fake contexts are presented to the model. In order to make the QA system robust to fake contexts, it proposes a misinformation-aware framework that combines the score of the model with a trust score outputs by a fake detector, which is a transformer-based model trained to classify if a context is real or fake. The results show that under this setting, model performance decreases, and that the reduction can be mitigate by applying the fake detector model. Finally, it shows a comparison, between BART-FG and GPT-2, to identify which of the two can generate more impactful fake contexts for the QA model.  The purpose idea of the dataset is valuable, as well as the problem is proposing to address. However, there are some problems that do not allow me for acceptance. \n\nProblem statement. \n1)\tA considerable part of the paper is dedicated to the generation of the so-called contradicting examples. However, the way in which they are generated is in line with other works (cited in the paper as well) where the original text is perturbed by modifying entities. What makes the examples in ContraQA contradicting examples? A definition is indeed required. \n\n2)\tThe problem of misinformation has been explored in the literature, and many works treat the task as a fact checking problem. Because the literature regarding fact-checking is not considered at all in the paper, what makes the problem addressed in this work different from fact checking? If the ultimate goal is to design models that are robust to misinformation, fact-checking should be definitely considered, and models for fact-checking should be included in the evaluation. Refer to https://fever.ai/ for more details on the fact-checking literature and datasets.\n\n3)\tThe setup proposed in this paper is not simulating a real-word scenario, as instead claimed in the introduction. While fake contexts can be presented, when doing retrieval to retrieve relevant documents, not all of them will contain fake context. Thus, the distribution between real/fake presented in this work does not reflect a real scenario. \n\nContribution of the paper. \n1)\tFake detector. While in the introduction the paper claims of proposing a framework to detect against misinformation, in practice this solution is a simple combination of the score of the QA model with a fake/real classifier. This poses several limitations, including a little ability of the model to generalize when new contexts arrive. SQuAD suffers from a train test overlap problem [1]. These findings will apply to the classifier as well because it is trained on the same data. It is unclear how much the framework for contradictory QA is learning how to rely on an information, rather than memorizing because of text was already seen in train. How does the detector perform when evaluated on a set of question, paragraph and contradicting text not seen at all in train? Based on the paper, the fake contexts are perturbation of the original text, to which extend do you expect the detector working because of memoization, rather than reasoning over the text? \n2)\tBART-FG model. The main focus of the paper goes into this model. From the results, it remains unclear how the produced context can be contradictory, and thus what makes these contexts different from context generated for adversarial attack of QA models. This observation goes with my previous point regarding the definition of contradicting examples. \n\nEthical concerns.\nThe fact that the model is based on BART, and can be easily reproduced, is not a valid justification to release the trained model BERT-FG. Same goes with the point regarding the limited ability to generate disinformation. While every generative model can be used in theory to create fake contexts, this work describes a way of generative fake contexts, without providing (based on the results), any robust approach to mitigate the problem. \n\n[1] Lewis at al., Question and Answer Test-Train Overlap in Open-Domain Question Answering Datasets The purpose idea of the dataset is valuable, as well as the problem is proposing to address.

Finally, the work gives a brief analysis on how SOTA QA systems perform on the new task, ContraQA, and proposes a misinformation detecting system which when unified with a Machine Reader performs significantly better than SOTA systems over ContraQA. **Strengths**:\n\n- To my belief, this is the first work that sets up contradicting contexts for closed-domain QA. It is very important for NLP and QA community to have more challenging evaluation benchmarks to understand how well models \"generalize\".\n- The work delineates an interesting study of how current QA systems perform when given contradicting contexts for reference, and also proposes a system that performs well at discriminating misinformation introduced by the ContraQA task.\n- The insight that human generated contradictions were \"stronger\" (were relatively more capable to fool QA systems) than Neural generations highlights the scope for developing better adversarial rewriting models.\n- The paper is fairly easy to follow\n\n**Weaknesses**:\n\nThe work leaves a few things to be desired:\n- The work only considers SQuAD which is demographically one of the most skewed datasets (Gor et. al. 2021).

                "content": "The authors studied how contradictory information affects the accuracy of QA systems.  They created a new dataset of ~10k from SQuAD with added contradictory paragraphs (context). The contradictory data was generated by two different ways. The authors employed Amazon Mechanical Turks raters to rewrite the original context. They also designed a BART-FG model to automatically produce such context by replacing spans with model generated value. \n\nThe authors also proposed a way to help QA systems avoid contradictory information. A RoBERTa-based model was used to classify a context into trustworthy or not, with an accuracy around 80%. The trustworthiness score is then used to weigh the final result, together with existing scores of quality/confidence.\n\nEvaluation was done with the new dataset. It showed that 1) adding contradictory information hurts QA performance badly, 2) the RoBERTa-based classifier can help regain some of the loss, but not all of them. The authors also measured the effectiveness of contradictory information creation, where human takes the top place by producing the least altered context with largest effect on final outcome.\n\nThe authors promised to share the dataset and the source code / weights of the proposed models. They further discussed the potential ethical impact of releasing the data, arguing that it's net beneficial.\n Strength. \n\n- It calls our attention to a very realistic problem, that misinformation could affect the QA systems, which a lot of people may blindly rely on.\n- Its pledge to share the data. It will help future studies in the same direction.\n- The description of data preparation and characteristics is very detailed and convincing.\n- The experiments are very detailed.\n- The paper itself is well-written and easy to follow.\n\nWeakness: Let me order them from most to least important.\n\n- It's not clear how we can tell the truth from the contradictory ones based on content only, and how the RoBERTa-based classifier did it (to 80%). For example, a common way to create the contradictory context is to replace one or more of the time/location or named entities (\"San Francisco\" -> \"Atlanta\"), or changing modifiers (\"all the time\" -> \"all the time except Sunday\"). It would be impossible for humans to tell, without strong background knowledge. Reviewer is very curious about what the classifier had learned, which is not discussed in the paper.\n\n- Leveraging the trustworthiness of the source, which seems like an apparent solution to Reviewer, is not discussed in the paper, at least not in the related work. For example, a quick search in Google Scholar led me to https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0165551513478893.\n\n- How Gap Constituency Filling (GCF) Pre-Training produce a *contradictory* filler. The pre-training will result in the most likely filler. Avoiding the original text will make sure it's different, but not necessarily contradictory. How did the authors make sure it's contradictory? It's worth explaining.\n\n- In section 3.1 the requirement to human labelers, the authors insist that \"The worker should make at least M edits at different places, where M equals to one plus the number of sentences in the contexts\". Reviewer is not clear why we need this specific minimum\".\n  \n The paper proposed a novel study of QA system robustness under contradictory information. It's well written and provides a new dataset. However the discussion around how a classifier could tell truth from noise and why don't we leverage source authority are missing. Some smaller issues exist too. Reviewer would like to see the two bigger questions answered. \n"

                "content": "This paper releases a new dataset with human and machine generated contradictory contexts for QA pairs from SQuAD 1.1. Amazon Mechanical Turk Workers are shown a paragraph and are asked to make edits such that it contradicts the original paragraph with respect to elements such as time, outcome, purpose, location, etc. In addition, the authors fine tune BART on a collection of masked constituent parses of Wikipedia sentences and it is then trained to fill the mask with an alternative phrase.  To automatically generate contradictory contexts, the authors use this fine tuned the BART model on the masked constituency parse of paragraph sentences. A dataset of 10,000 paragraphs from SQuAD  are transformed (once by mechanical Turk workers, and the rest by three different transformations by the BART Model). The paper presents experiments on this dataset for the task of QA -- specifically, machine reading comprehension. In one experiment, the QA system is first trained to predict which of the 5 (1 real + 4 contradictory) is correct. Then an off-the-shelf span based passage reader returns spans as answers. In the second experiment, the performance of QA models is compared on the unmodified SQuAD dataset as well as a version where a distracting passage is also added to context (by randomly choosing a different passage). The authors experiment using BERT, ROBERTA and SPAN-BERT and report a drop in performance in both experimental settings. In addition experiments reveal that models return worse performance on the subset of the data created by human workers ( perhaps unsurprising). Additional studies on the nature of edits have also been presented. \n\nOverall a well written and easy to read paper. However, I am not sure I am clear about the goals of the paper -- I elaborate further in the rest of the review. \n\n\n 1. What is the goal of the paper? If the goal is to present a dataset that is about misinformation -- it is not simply enough to create a contradictory passages. This is just another way of distracting a QA model but without having any reason for it to believe the information is \"fake\". In order for something to be \"fake\", there has to be some ground-truth known. The experiment called Contra-QA appears to be flawed given what it was supposed to check. How is a model expected to learn which passage is real? It has to be grounded in something that it can rely on for evidence isn't it? Would human beings know if something is fake unless there are also aware of what a \"trustworthy\" source says? Perhaps the authors can elaborate further (in case I have badly misunderstood the work). \n\n2. Similarly, if you add contradictory information to passages for a span-based QA model its no surprise it gets confused. Neither are those models trained to not respond in the presence of contradictory information nor are they being told which passage is real (the trust-score is truly not a trust-score -- it is just the output of a model that  frankly appears to be guessing because it has no way of knowing what is trustworthy!). \n\n3. What could perhaps have been interesting is to also see if a model could \"detect\" contradictions and says, that it should not answer. This is a model that you can easily train with this data and perhaps the only thing meaningful I can think of doing with this dataset without having any access to methods that tell the system what is \"real\". \n\nI found the methods for generating contradictory passages novel and interesting and could find more general use in other tasks related to dataset augmentation. That limited contribution, however is not enough to accept this paper in its current form.   The paper's experiments do not back up the claims of reasoning for misinformation. It is about reasoning with contradictory information and its no surprise QA models dont know what to answer when that happens. Why is this surprising? What is the goal of the work. \nI apologize if I have badly misunderstood the work and I'd encourage the authors to discuss these comments in the rebuttal. "

                "content": "In reinforcement learning, pre-trained low-level skills have the potential to greatly facilitate exploration. However, prior knowledge of the downstream task is required to strike the right balance between generality (fine-grained control) and specificity (faster learning) in skill design. In previous work on continuous control, the sensitivity of methods to this trade-off has not been addressed explicitly, as locomotion provides a suitable prior for navigation tasks, which have been of foremost interest. In this work, we analyze this trade-off for low-level policy pre-training with a new benchmark suite of  diverse, sparse-reward tasks for bipedal robots. We alleviate the need for prior knowledge by proposing a hierarchical skill learning framework that acquires skills of varying complexity in an unsupervised manner. For utilization on downstream tasks, we present a three-layered hierarchical learning algorithm to automatically trade off between general and specific skills as required by the respective task. In our experiments, we show that our approach performs this trade-off effectively and achieves better results than current state-of-the-art methods for end-to-end hierarchical reinforcement learning and unsupervised skill discovery.\n"

                "content": "This work proposes a benchmark task with bipedal robots instead of locomotion tasks, where the bipedal robots are low dimensional and perform various movements. It also proposes a hierarchical reinforcement learning method with three levels: a policy that specifies a goal space (a set of features to operate on), a policy to specify the goal configuration given that goal space, and a low level policy to reach the desired goal configuration. It learns the low level policies through unsupervised learning, and then optimizes off policy the high level options by optimizing the value function.  Abstract: It is not clear throughout the abstract what the \"inductive bias\" is. It is not clear how the \"the potential to facilitate exploration\" is an inductive bias. since this is the primary distinction on which this work centers, this makes the abstract confusing.\n\nIntroduction:\n24 While it is true that much of the work in exploration with hierarchical reinforcement learning deals in navigation or navigation-like domains where the center of mass of the agent is particularly useful, there also exists a large body of work which deals with exploration related to object manipulation where this assumption is not the case. Thus, the generalization expressed here is misleading, since it highlights that \"the work that benefits from center of mass knowledge has an implicit bias towards center of mass knowledge.\"\n\n30 While this is true of policies, it may not be the case that low level skills are more widely applicable, since individual skills, low level or high level might be limited to a a very small set of behavior. It would probably be more appropriate to refer to this in the context of policies.\n\nRelated work:\n77 While re-usability across different high level actions is a significant benefit, this underscores the idea that one of the large benefits of Hierarchical reinforcement learning is for exploration. Even if a primitive is only used for one task, it might be that the learning procedure is able to exhibit gains in performance or sample efficiency even without generalizability. While it is likely that navigation tasks as a test domain does introduce implicit biases, it is not clear from the description in this section why this is the case.\n\nHierarchical skill learning: \nThe \"introduction\" section for this component lacks a heading, and it is not clear exactly what it is expressing. Is this part a description of the low level policies? A description of the state space or of general terms? At this point it remains unclear what exactly the high level policy comprises, and why there are task specific features and additional objects separated out to be accessed only by the high level policy. While these components gain some clarity later, the ordering makes this confusing.\n\n107 It is not clear up to this point if the argument is being made for more specific, or less specific policies. However, while such a low-level policy as reaching a goal configuration after short time is not navigation related, it is certainly very specific to robotic motion.\n\n3.1 While it is reasonable to train low level skills over different sets of features, perhaps the most important property related to these would be how they are chosen. It is not clear if these features are selected as random samples or specified. However, random sampling seems like a suspect way, as if the number of features exceeds even a small amount the number of possible sets explodes exponentially.\n\nTraining the low level policies only by unsupervised pre-training also seems like it could introduce issues. In particular, while the low level space might afford many bad ways of controlling the agent, there are probably only a limited number of useful ways to control the agent. There should be a tradeoff between using the higher level policies to specify what is learned at the lower levels, and simply exploring with the lower level policies, but at present the former appears to be completely ignored.\n\n3.2 Equation numbers would be much appreciated in this section, especially since there are clear changes being made to the typical bellman equation/value function, not the least of which is in the notation of taking the feature mean. \n166 While matching sign seems like it should have an effect on optimization, by negating the log of the features, this seems to change the meaning of the equation. \n\n170 It is not entirely clear how the equation in line 164 arrives at the one in 170. In particular, it seems that the loss is the negative expected value, but then the log|F| component has disappeared.\n\n173 A more in-depth description of how the \\alpha and \\beta loss terms are defined is necessary. At this point, it is simply provided as a given without clear explanation, especially since the intuitive meaning of H^f, H^g is not made clear.\n\nBenchmark Environments:\nWhile these environments are provided as one of the clear contributions of this work, they are described fleetingly. It would be useful to note why properties like center of mass or other normal navigation \"implicit biases\" do not apply to these cases. \n\nExperimental results:\n211 With only 5 features, these proposed domains do not actually differ too significantly from other mujoco locomotion tasks that are more commonly given. As highlighted before, the number of features also seems necessary for this method to work since the subset sampling would explode exponentially otherwise.\n\n227 It is still unclear what emphasis is being made about \"no single skill\" In particular, it should be expected in any skill learning framework that one skill does not dominate, otherwise there would be no point in using the framework at all.\n\nFigure 4: it is hard to parse the results, in particular those of SD*. Is this meant to outperform the proposed method?\n\n5.2 The proposed baselines, while interesting, do not always capture a fair comparison. In particular they are all single level skill learning methods except for DIAYN, but in this case DIAYN-C does not appear to be ideal for this case.\n\nFigure 6: It is not entirely clear why SAC would completely fail for the given tasks. It would be useful to see a comparison against SAC where it is able to learn at least some useful behavior, or find another baseline that does give valid results. There should exist algorithms which function on humanoid walker.\n\nOverall, this work proposes an interesting way of selecting features to control over and an effective 3 level hierarchy which has encouraging results. While the idea of selecting features has been proposed, it has not been shown in a multi-level hierarchy. However, the writing is sufficiently difficult to parse such that it is difficult to determine how exactly this method is novel from existing work, except that it encodes more specific information for the tasks. It is also difficult to determine from the writing exactly what features of the proposed method contribute to the success. Furthermore, the experiments are limited because they test on a new domain against baselines that do not seem like fair comparison on that domain. \n\nOriginality: marginal\n\nQuality: marginal\n\nClarity: poor\n\nSignificance: below marginal\n This work has a limited discussion of limitations, particularly how closely the method is tied to the task being performed. It has no discussion of societal impact, though robotics has a large variety of effects on modern society so a discussion could have occurred."

                "content": "The authors propose a 3-level hierarchical method, one that operates on a feature space, another that operates on a feature-conditioned goal space, and finally a low level policy that outputs actions in the environment conditioned on everything above and the current state. They pretrain the policies in a pretraining environment before applying it to the task at hand. The authors also introduce a new suite of environments to test hierarchical RL. The issues brought up by the authors about current HRL methods are enlightening and the method is a novel contribution. Results are fine, with subtle/no improvements over the baselines on some tasks, and substantive improvements on others. I believe the paper has some issues with baseline comparisons and tasks, which I hope will be addressed in the rebuttal. As such, I am currently learning towards not accepting the paper.  ## Paper Strengths\n**Paper Framing/Originality**\nPointing out the issues with existing HRL algorithms\u2019 focus on learning skills that are relevant mainly for controlling center of mass is an interesting contribution. Furthermore, the algorithm that results is novel, while also incorporating ideas from modern papers such as the DYNE step-conditioned critic. The inclusion (and supposed release) of the benchmark environments are a benefit to the community as some of them seem like solid tasks to test hierarchical algorithms on.\n\n**Results Significance**\nI think the paper does a good job of demonstrating the importance of goal-space separation with results that demonstrate significant improvements over baselines on some of the tasks. Furthermore, it\u2019s rare to see evaluations over 3 seeds, while the authors evaluate on 9 seeds in total. The inductive bias experiment on HIRO in the appendix (sec G) was very enlightening.\nThe experiment shown in Figure 3 is also very comprehensive and informative.\n\n**Clarity**\nOverall, the writing is generally clear and mathematical derivations are pretty well explained. \n\n## Paper Weaknesses\n\n**Sparse-reward tasks**\nI think more analysis on similar environments with different robots should be given. Tmake general claims about this method, there should be examples of many robots, not just two. Furthermore, the demonstrating an experiment like Figure 3 for another robot (perhaps the Humanoid that\u2019s already included) would be helpful.\n\n**Experiments**\nThere should be comparisons with some works which learn skills without explicit assumptions of skill/task types and do not require pre-training skills, e.g. HIDIO (Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning By Discovering Intrinsic Options, Zhang et al. 2021), HiPPO (Sub-policy Adaptation for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning, Li et al. 2020). These comparisons would further demonstrate the advantages of having the initial pretraining environments (which the comparison to SAC-HIRO already contributes to) and explicit goal space learning when compared with more modern HRL methods, both of which have demonstrated improvements over HIRO in their experiments. In a sense, HIRO is the only true SOTA HRL baseline in this paper so this would need to be addressed.\n\nThere\u2019s little explicit analysis that studies how exploration is explicitly affected by these skills, despite it being stressed in the introduction. This can be partially remedied by adding more analysis in Section 5.1 regarding exploration specific to each environment (I think Sec 5.1 is also just generally lacking more analysis). \n\n\n**Clarity**\nI think that an example of the feature set F should be given earlier in the paper, it\u2019s confusing to learn bits and pieces about feature sets F throughout section 3 before getting an example (perhaps at L108). This also makes the distance-based reward (L135) clearer when introduced.\n\nYou should bold or highlight the best performances for each column in Table 1. That would improve clarity here greatly.\n\n\n**Minor Issues**\nSome grammatical hiccups throughout the 3rd paragraph of the introduction, making it a little harder to read.\n\n\nFigure 4: \u201caveraged over 0.5M environment steps\u201d this should be 5M steps\n\nL271: \u201cfor SG\u201d -> \u201cfor SD\u201d? Or for subgoals?\n\nAppendix L597, equation:  F -> |F|\n\n## Questions for the authors\n\nHow do you anticipate extending this to visual environments? \n\nWhy are you normalizing the entropy of $\\pi^g$ by $|F|$? Isn\u2019t the size of $F$ fixed?\n\nIt seems that many of the fixed skill experiments achieve performance nearly on par with full HSD-3. Why is this the case when it seems in Figure 5 many skills are needed?\n\n\n--UPDATE--: raised score from 5 to 6 after response\n Yes."

The results for different discriminator features are as follows (mean values over 3 seeds, after 5M environment steps, comparable to the numbers in Table 1 of our paper):\n\n```\nDiscriminator feature  | Hurdles | Limbo | Stairs | PoleBalance\n================================================================\nState                  | -0.12   | -0.09 | -0.02  | 81.69  \nAction                 | -0.98   | -0.90 | -0.99  | 128.25\nStateAction            | -0.09   | -0.01 | -0.04  | 112.01\n```\n\nNegative returns are obtained if the Walker falls over in the course of an episode. We've used the hyper-parameters for the Pusher/Reacher experiments in the HIDIO paper, and are currently sweeping the parameter ranges given in D.1.3 on the Hurdles task. We will follow up with the results from the sweep within the next two days.\n\n### Analyzing Exploration\n\nWe ran an experiment with both (non-hierarchical) SAC and HSD-3 on the GoalWall environmet (one of the most challenging tasks of the benchmark suite), and counted the number of unique states using the SimHash method from http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04717. After 5M steps, HSD-3 visited roughly twice as many unique states compared to SAC (400k vs. 200k, https://imgur.com/a/qqHVW6P). We will generate these curves for the remaining methods and tasks for the updated version of the paper."

We thank you for pointing out the ALLSTEPS reference, which does indeed eschew motion capture data, but in exchange for a dense, carefully designed reward function and task curricula. We will include it in our related work section.\n\n3. A forward reward alone is not sufficient for either GoalWall or PoleBalance, and HSD-3 achieves good results in both of them (with the Walker robot). The focus on sparse-reward environments is motivated by the fact that as tasks grow in complexity, coming up with suitably shaped rewards requires an increasing amount of effort. Naturally, deriving good rewards from e.g. demonstrations is another way to tackle complex tasks, but this direction is orthogonal to our work."

In the response to reviewer ECxq, the authors claim \"Our work demonstrates skill learning and usage for a Humanoid robot without supervision from motion capture data, which has not been shown previously outside of navigation tasks.\" That is not true. Please refer to literature in computer animation. For example, ALLSTEPS: Curriculum-driven Learning of Stepping Stone Skills, by Xie et al can do more challenging locomotion tasks presented here without motion capture.\n\n3. While I understand the scope of the paper is to solve sparse reward tasks, but my question remains, most of the tasks presented can be solved via very simple forward progress reward (this is not a complicated inductive bias). And the only task that I couldn't figure out a simple dense reward alternative is not solvable by the proposed approach. I think this limitation should be addressed, e.g, in the appendix."

Regarding some of your comments, I have a few things to point out.\n\n> Regarding HiPPO, the experiments in the original paper (https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByeWogStDS) are performed in environments where PPO works well already, while non-HRL methods seem to fail almost completely in our tasks. We hence did not consider it as a baseline.\n\nI don't think that its experiments being performed in environments where PPO already works well implies that it'll fail on your tasks. In HIDIO's experiments, in which I believe they run an unmodified version of HiPPO, HiPPO performs well on some tasks where flat policies fail. In fact, some of the tasks in HiPPO are semantically similar to the ones evaluated in your environment (there's a \"Block Hopper\" and \"Block Half-Cheetah\" in HiPPO). However, I think it's OK to just include one modern hierarchical baseline, which HIDIO satisfies. Specifically regarding HIDIO:\n\n> In quick preliminary experiments on Hurdles, Stairs, and GoalWall, using the actions as input to the discriminator, HIDIO did not make meaningful progress in 5M steps apart from learning to not fall over. We will do additional runs using the parameter ranges and variants listed in the paper and add it as a baseline for the camera ready.\n\nCan you include a preliminary table of results in a future response to this comment? I understand it's hard to setup your environment tasks and perform a full hyperparameter search for any method with an unfamiliar codebase in a short amount of time, so feel free to just put preliminary results, but not having the extra baseline is my primary concern and I would like to see it fully addressed. \n\n\nFurthermore, the authors did not address this concern of mine:\n> There\u2019s little explicit analysis that studies how exploration is explicitly affected by these skills, despite it being stressed in the introduction. This can be partially remedied by adding more analysis in Section 5.1 regarding exploration specific to each environment (I think Sec 5.1 is also just generally lacking more analysis).\n\nCould you address this in a response? I think Section 5.1 should be expanded upon, or given limited space, an additional pointer to the appendix added and extra analysis inserted there. It's very interesting as is.\n\n"

                "content": " We thank the reviewer for their valuable feedback and insightful comments. We will address the potential weaknesses that were pointed out individually:\n\n**Sparse-reward tasks:** In general, we view our benchmark task as a first installment and to be potentially extended with further tasks and robots in the future as we agree that methods should be benchmarked in as many scenarios as possible. For this work, we limited our focus on bipedal robots of different complexity. The experiment on individual goal spaces (Figure 3) has also been performed for the Humanoid, although we limited the number of candidate goal spaces to those including translation in X direction. The results are provided in Figure 8 in the Supplementary and paint a similar picture (no single best goal space across tasks).\n\n**Experiments:** The extended results in the Supplementary (Table 5) include an additional end-to-end baseline (Switching Ensemble, from http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10618). While it doesn't learn a high-level policy, it has been shown to be on par with learning a set of discrete low-level options in http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10618. Regarding HiPPO, the experiments in the original paper (https://openreview.net/forum?id=ByeWogStDS) are performed in environments where PPO works well already, while non-HRL methods seem to fail almost completely in our tasks. We hence did not consider it as a baseline. HIDIO was published only recently (ICLR 2021). In quick preliminary experiments on Hurdles, Stairs, and GoalWall, using the actions as input to the discriminator, HIDIO did not make meaningful progress in 5M steps apart from learning to not fall over. We will do additional runs using the parameter ranges and variants listed in the paper, and add it as a baseline for the camera ready.\n\n**Clarity:** We provide an example of our skills in the introduction, but will also pick it up again in Section 3 for clarity. We will also address the minor issues that the reviewer helpfully pointed out.\n\n**Questions:**\n- *Visual environments:* Image observations don't directly allow for definitions of goal spaces as in our work. We think that investigating whether these goal spaces can be learned would be worthwhile, as a means to both remove the remaining prior of manual goal space in our method, and to tackle more complex state spaces such as images. Another possibility would be unsupervised keypoint extraction, e.g., as in \"Unsupervised Learning of Object Keypoints for Perception and Control\" (http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11883), and to construct goal spaces around those keypoints. For the particular environments in our paper, it would also be possible to restrict pre-training tasks to proprioceptive inputs and supply the high-level policy with image observations of downstream tasks, such as in \"Hierarchical Visuomotor Control of Humanoids\" (https://openreview.net/forum?id=BJfYvo09Y7).\n- *Normalization of entropy:* The size of \\mathcal{F} and the total number of goal space features is fixed, but the subsets F \\in \\mathcal{F} differ in size. For example, for F={xpos}, there is only one continuous action for \\pi^g, while for F={xpos,zpos,left_foot} there are 4 actions (left_foot corresponds to two actual features). We normalize the entropy by |F| to not bias the Q-function towards large feature subsets, which would be the case for the standard SAC formulation.\n- *Many skills achieve good results:* All our individual skills are goal-based policies in a continuous goal space and can be used to express a relatively large range of different motions on their own. For example, it's possible to find goal sequences to move forward in X direction by just controlling a single foot (Fig. 3). This is because the skill policy needs to balance the agent to not fall over, and other features, like the torso position, are not constrained to specific values in this case. Finding these goal sequences can however be challenging, which is demonstrated by the mediocre performance of HSD-Bandit. HDS-3 is free to switch between different skills (i.e., goal spaces), and in Figure 5 we demonstrate that semantically meaningful switching sequences can arise. Here, we don't place any constraints on finding a small set of best goal spaces."

                "content": " We thank the reviewer for their valuable feedback and comments. We will address the smaller issues pointed out in the write-up and provide detailed answers to the listed cons and questions below:\n\n**Comutational requirement for pre-training:** For the Walker, we use 10M steps for pre-training a shared policy for all goal spaces considered. With uniform sampling over goal spaces, this leads to an expectation of about 322k environment steps per goal space, or skill. Learning a single skill (e.g., moving towards an X-position) in an isolated manner with SAC required significantly more samples in preliminary experiments, and this only increases for more complex skills. Considering the fact that we learn skill policies for 31 goal spaces simultaneously, we think that the resource requirements for pre-training are reasonable.\nFor clarity, we will also attach per-skill learning curves with the average rewards reached (in training) to the Appendix.\n\n**Task design:** We agree that designing these tasks is non-trivial, and we consider the investigation into further tasks (especially for Humanoid robots) as a worthwhile future endeavor. We believe that the current suite represents a good first step with 7 varied environments.\n\n**Performance on Gaps:** This task is indeed very challenging since a positive reward is only observed if the robot reaches the next platform. If it touches the Gap (slightly lower than the floor), it receives the same -1 reward as for falling over.\n\n**Performance gain over non-HRL with forward reward:** So far, we found that in dense-reward settings (Hurdles, Limbo, HurdleLimbo, Gaps, Stairs with a reward corresponding to the translation in X-direction per step), the final performance of our method and other HRL approaches we investigated is lower than for plain SAC. We believe this is mainly a limitation of using fixed low-level skills. In the future, it would be interesting to study how to adapt the low-level skills on downstream tasks, or how to use the HRL policy purely for exploration to get good initial traces; we believe this to be out scope for this submission though, as the focus is on improved exploration in sparse-reward settings.\n\n**SAC on Stairs:** Only one out of 9 seeds managed to make meaningful learning progress on the Stairs task, which is not enough to significantly move the average reported in Figure 4. It can be noticed in Table 1, and we will add a corresponding remark in the discussion of results in 5.2 for clarity."

We show rollouts of the pre-training stage and downstream tasks for both robots, and compare the behavior of HSD-3 to several baselines.\n\nWalker experiments were run with 9 seeds each (for methods with pre-trained skills we use 3 pre-training and 3 high-level training seeds). A lower bound of the number of episodes can be derived from the time limit: for the Walker, 5M steps correspond to at least 5000 episodes (time limit 1000) for all tasks except GoalWall (at least 20000 episodes, time limit 250). All environments implement early termination if the robot falls over, so in practice the total number of episodes will be higher.\n\nWe will add a motivation for the selection of our goal space features, and will also reference Heess et al., 2016 (skill learning with a navigation prior) and Hasenclever et al., 2020 (highlighting importance of in-domain motion capture data (as a prior), and proposing joint skill learning and downstream task training as a remedy).

                "content": " We thank the reviewer for the extensive commentary and suggestions. We group the issues that were raised and respond to them individually.\n\n**Inductive bias:** What we call inductive bias is the prior that is used for exploration on downstream tasks, and hence represents a priori knowledge about what comprises useful behavior in a given environment. Settling for more generality will make pre-trained skills applicable to a larger class of environments, but exploration will be more challenging. Hence, a trade-off arises. For example, controlling the center of mass is effective in navigation environments but not helpful for kicking a soccer ball. This would intuitively require control of the robot's extremities, which is again not useful for exploration in navigation tasks. We will try to present this in a clearer manner in the introduction.\n\n**Novelty:** We clearly work out the role of priors in pre-trained skills, and propose a novel three-level architecture to effectively tackle the trade-off that arises when introducing these priors. Our work demonstrates skill learning and usage for a Humanoid robot without supervision from motion capture data, which has not been shown previously outside of navigation tasks.\n\n**Baselines:** The failure of SAC is explained by the sparse-reward nature of our tasks that require agents with effective exploration capabilities. Occasional SAC runs do make progress on the Stairs task, and after a longer training time on Hurdles (Table 5 & 6). In Table 5, we also give results for the Switching Ensemble (from http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10618), which improves exploration for SAC and finds effective solutions occasionally. We believe that this answers the reviewer's point on providing a simple baseline that works at least sporadically. DIAYN-C embeds a fixed number of discrete skills in a continuous space, and can hence interpolate between them (http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10299); we regard it as a superior formulation of DIAYN. In contrast to the baselines, our method is novel in its usage of multiple skills, with each one implemented as a goal-based policy. We are not aware of any similar multi-skill algorithm that would be applicable to our scenario. SD* is considered a topline because it requires exhaustive evaluation on a downstream task -- it is the best goal space, selected a posteriori.\n\n**Benchmark Tasks:** While locomotion is an integral part of the majority of tasks, it is not sufficient to perform well across all of them. This is demonstrated in Figure 3: controlling the center of mass roughly corresponds to controlling X,Y and Z features which does indeed work well on 4 out of 7 tasks, but works poorly on the other 3. The Gaps task, for example, clearly requires control of at least one foot. Further, we can't completely follow the connection drawn by the reviewer between the number of goal space features and the similarity to existing MuJoCo locomotion tasks. The tasks are defined irrespective of the goal space features, and the features have been selected to enable a variety of behaviors for Walker robots (position of torso and the two lower appendages).\n\n**Unsupervised pre-training; guiding skill learning with high-level policies:** In this work, we focused on the scenario of first acquiring pre-trained skill policies, and then utilizing them in unseen downstream tasks. In preliminary experiments, running HSD-3 with uninitialized skills (i.e., from scratch) did not work well; perhaps this could be mitigated with additional inductive biases on which skills should be learned at what point in time, or with a CoMic-like setup (http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/hasenclever20a.html).\n\n**Section 3.2:** The equations are taken from the SAC paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05905v2) and adapted to our setting. In the interest of brevity, we do not include the full derivation of the SAC losses but refer to the original paper instead. We will motivate the presence of two temperature loss terms in the camera-ready version; the main idea is that the two high-level policies are sufficiently different and benefit from independent entropy regularization."

With this aim, a one-shot supernet is usually leveraged as a performance evaluator to rank the performance \\wrt~different width. Nevertheless, current methods mainly follow a manually fixed weight sharing pattern, which is limited to distinguish the performance gap of different width. In this paper, to better evaluate each width, we propose a locally free weight sharing strategy (CafeNet) accordingly. In CafeNet, weights are more freely shared, and each width is jointly indicated by its base channels and free channels, where free channels are supposed to locate freely in a local zone to better represent each width. Besides, we propose to further reduce the search space by leveraging our introduced FLOPs-sensitive bins. As a result, our CafeNet can be trained stochastically and get optimized within a min-min strategy. Extensive experiments on ImageNet, CIFAR-10, CelebA and MS COCO dataset have verified our superiority comparing to other state-of-the-art baselines. For example, our method can further boost the benchmark NAS network EfficientNet-B0 by 0.41\\% via searching its width more delicately."

We have revised the presentation issue and typos of this paper in our next version.\n\nQ1: More explanations with the smallest training loss. \\\nA1: Since network width is specified more freely by several sub-networks in CafeNet, and the performance of these sub-networks can be different. Therefore, to directly compare the performance of different network width, we need to specify an indicator for each network width. For example, use the Top-1 accuracy of all sub-networks (CafeNet) or other methods that involve more sub-networks(e.g., the average accuracy of all sub-networks). Although there are countless ways to specify the indicator, these ways will undoubtedly introduce more computation for each width, and also sub-networks with poor performance may not well represent the performance of width. Therefore, to indicate the performance w.r.t network width, we propose to leverage the sub-network with maximum performance, which amounts to the smallest training loss.\n\nQ2: More details of Eq. (7). \\\nA2: Since the FLOPs of a layer is linear to the number of filters(channels), to evaluate the influence of filters, we propose to construct the FLOPs-sensitivity of a layer by examining the real FLOPs variation of reducing a single filter. In detail, a filter influences the output channel for the current layer and the input channel as the next layer, which corresponds to two terms of Eq. (7).\n\nQ3: Selection of layer width with Eq. (2). \\\nA3: In our method, for the given FLOPs constraint, the search is implemented with random or evolutionary search, named CafeNet-R and CafeNet-E in all tables. In detail, for evolutionary search, we implement it with the multi-objective NSGA-II algorithm [1]. As illustrated in Appendix A.2, we set the population and iteration size of evolutionary search to 40 and 50, and we randomly select 40 network width within the FLOPs budget as the initial population. In each generation,  with each width satisfying the FLOPs budget, we specify the sub-network with the strategy of max-max selection to indicate its performance. Then, we assign the validation accuracy (the validation dataset is split from the training dataset) of the specified sub-network for the width to indicate its performance. For those sampled network width with larger FLOPs, we just drop them. Afterward, the network width with the highest score is selected as the optimal width to train from scratch for evaluation.\nWhile for the random search, we uniformly sample the same number of network width as the evolutionary search. Then, for each network width satisfying the FLOPs budget, we specify the sub-network with the strategy of max-max selection and examine its validation accuracy. Afterward, we select the width with the highest accuracy to train from scratch for evaluation. \\\n [1] Deb, Kalyanmoy, et al. \"A fast and elitist multiobjective genetic algorithm: NSGA-II.\" IEEE transactions on evolutionary computation 6.2 (2002): 182-197.\n\nQ4. Zero width issue for a layer. \\\nA4: The current setting of CafeNet cannot reach 0 width for two reasons. First, as described in Eq. (5), we limit the width of each layer to no less than 1. Second, even if 0 width can be selected as a candidate, the performance of the corresponding sub-network will be greatly restricted due to the existence of the disconnected layer, and thus cannot be selected as the optimal width through evolution or random search.\n\nQ5. Presentation issue of Fig. 2(b). \\\nA5: Thanks for pointing out this issue. In fact, $\\lambda$ in the text corresponds to $1 - \\lambda$ in Fig 2(b). Therefore, some descriptions of min-min optimization should be revised as follows:  \nDuring training CafeNet, we only optimize the sub-network with minimum training loss for each sampled width. To investigate the effect of this optimization strategy, suppose we have all $\\tau$ iterations, then we implement min-min optimization only on the last $(1-\\lambda)\\cdot\\tau$ iterations with $\\lambda\\in[0,1]$. For the first $\\lambda\\cdot\\tau$ iterations, we simply optimize one sub-network randomly for each sampled width. As shown in Fig. 2(b), our 0.5$\\times$-FLOPs MobileNetV2 on CIFAR-10 improves 0.92\\% accuracy from $\\lambda = 1$ to $\\lambda = 0$.\n\nQ6. More experiments of searched network width with aligned hyperparameter settings. \\\nA6: Thanks for your advice. As illustrated in Appendix A.10, we retrain the searched network width with the same training recipes of AutoSlim, as shown in Table. 14. Some examples of the comparisons are shown below: \\\n1G FLOPs of ResNet50: \\\nAutoSlim: 74.0\\%, CafeNet: 74.5\\% \\\n207M FLOPs of MobileNetV2: \\\nAutoSlim: 73.0\\%, CafeNet:  73.2\\% \\\nMore details about the retraining results can refer to as Table. 14 of Appendix A.10. With the same training recipes of the baseline method (AutoSlim), the results in Appendix A.10 show the effectiveness of our proposed CafeNet.\n\n\n\n\n"

We have revised the typos and polished our presentation according to the response below.\n\nQ1: Discussion of related papers. \\\nA1: Thanks for reminding of the related works. OFA proposes to train a supernet that supports diverse architectural settings by decoupling training and search; thus, it can be quickly used to get a specialized sub-network without additional training. TF-NAS proposes a novel method to boost the search with three levels of differentiable NAS (i.e.,  operation-level, depth-level, and width-level).  With this method,  TF-NAS achieves good performance in terms of both classification accuracy and precise latency constraint.  We have cited these papers (i.e., OFA and TF-NAS) in the first paragraph of introduction.\n\n\nQ2: Correlation of weight sharing degree with performance under the same FLOPs. \\\nA2: Indeed, higher degrees of freedom will lead to better search results. As shown in Figure 2(a), with the same FLOPs budget, accuracy performance benefits from the increase of $r$. In detail, when $r$ is set to 1, a large gap is introduced in comparison to $r = 0$ (fixed weight pattern); this is because a better representation for each width is induced with the freedom in selecting channels.  However, when $r$ goes larger, the increase of performance of searched width gradually slows down, which means using a small offset $r$ can already help distinguish the performance of different width, thus helping to select the optimal width.\n\nQ3: Typo of Eq. (9). \\\nA3: The Eq. (9) should be revised to $ b_i = \\beta \\times \\frac{\\max_j \\varepsilon_j}{\\varepsilon_i}$.  Thanks for pointing out this typo. Since we specify the minimum bin size as $\\beta$, and bin size is inverse to the sensitivity $\\varepsilon$ as defined in Eq. (8). Therefore, the minimum bin size should correspond to the maximum sensitivity.  With this revised Eq. (9),  the second term on the right side of Eq. (9)  will always be $\\geq$ 1. As for the definition of $\\beta$, in practical implementation, the number of channels in each bin should be an integer and greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, in the code level, the bin size $b_i$ should be implemented as $b_i = round(\\max(b_i, 1))$. As a result, $\\beta \\leq 1$ means that the bin size of several layers with $\\varepsilon$ close to the maximum sensitivity $\\max_j \\varepsilon_j$ are defined to 1, which induces a larger search space.\n\nQ4: Presentation issue of Fig. 2(b). \\\nA4: Sorry for the inconsistent meanings of lambda. In fact, $\\lambda$ in the text corresponds to $1 - \\lambda$ in Fig 2(b). Therefore, the descriptions of min-min optimization should be revised as follows:   \\\nDuring training CafeNet, we only optimize the sub-network with minimum training loss for each sampled width. To investigate the effect of this optimization strategy, suppose we have all $\\tau$ iterations, then we implement min-min optimization only on the last $(1-\\lambda)\\cdot\\tau$ iterations with $\\lambda\\in[0,1]$. For the first $\\lambda\\cdot\\tau$ iterations, we simply optimize one sub-network randomly for each sampled width. As shown in Fig. 2(b), our 0.5$\\times$-FLOPs MobileNetV2 on CIFAR-10 improves 0.92\\% accuracy from $\\lambda = 1$ to $\\lambda = 0$, which means that min-min optimization does help to better evaluate each width and boost the searching performance accordingly. We further record the performance of 1K sampled width; details refer to Appendix A.13.\n\n\nQ5: Code release and other presentation suggestions: \\\nA5: Thanks for your suggestions. We will release our code after this paper is published, and we have modified the presentation of Table 1 and use $\\mathcal {E}$ (Epochs) to indicate the epochs in algorithm1.\n\n"

                "content": "Thanks for the comments. We have polished our writing, and the following answers have been revised accordingly in our next version.\n\nQ1: The relation between completely free weight and fixed weight. \\\nA1: For fixed weight pattern, it simply assigns the left $c$ channels as the sub-network for the width $c$. However, for the completely free weight pattern, to assign layer width of $c$ from $l$ channels in a layer, there will be $\\mathbb{C}^c_l$ kinds of configurations of weights, which is computationally unaffordable for practical search. Therefore, we bridge these two extreme situations by proposing a locally free weight sharing (CafeNet) strategy. In CafeNet, we split the channels of a layer into two parts, i.e., base channels and free channels, with base channels following the strategy of fixed weight sharing pattern while free channels from the neighborhood of the $c$-th channel with a preset allowed offset of $r$. The search space of our method scales at $\\mathcal{O}(\\mathbb{C}_{2r+1}^{r+1}n)$, which is only a constant time of (e.g., $\\mathcal{O}(3n)$ for $r = 1$) of fixed weight sharing search space.    \n\nQ2: The size of search space. \\\nA2: With the proposed locally free weight pattern, the size of the search space is indeed scaled from  $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(\\mathbb{C}_{2r+1}^{N})$. Instead of randomly sampling and optimizing the sub-networks, we focus on the sub-network with the best performance for a particular width. In other words, each width only corresponds to one sub-network, which largely enhances the efficiency. Details about this strategy of min-min optimization can be found in the Appendix with Eqs. (11-13). A similar strategy is applied during the evaluation of sub-networks as well. \n\nQ3: Analysis of freedom within CafeNet. \\\nA3: It is indeed that higher degrees of freedom will lead to better results. As shown in Figure 2(a), accuracy performance benefits from the increase of $r$ (more freedom). In detail, when $r$ is set to 1, a large gap is introduced in comparison to $r = 0$(fixed weight pattern); this is because a better representation for each width is induced with the free channels. However, when $r$ grows larger, the increase of searched width performance gradually slows down, which means using a small offset $r$ can already help distinguish the performance of different width. Thus a larger offsets $r$ can only lead to a little performance improvement with the selected width.  Nevertheless, the larger $r$ also aggravates the burden of training as Table 6. For a trade-off between performance and time cost, we set $r = 1$ in all experiments.\n\nQ4: Writing issue.  \\\nA4: We carefully proofread this paper and fix the typos.\n\n"

In this paper, we propose to leverage a more freely assigned weights pattern for network weights. Suppose we use both the locally free weight pattern and assign channels more freely(i.e., channels on the right side), which may cause an unfair comparison with the current mainstream baseline methods (algorithms with fixed weight pattern). However, with more freely assigned channels, network width search performance may be further increased, which can be researched as innovative work in the future.\n"

Besides, FLOPs-sensitive bins is proposed to measure the real FLOPs of a single channel at a layer and further reduce the search space. The paper proposes a locally free weight sharing mechanism where the channels in a layer are split into base channels and free channels. Compared with conventional fixed weight sharing pattern where the leftmost channels are assigned as the sub-network, the proposed locally free pattern increases more flexibility while the search space also scales at O(n). The proposed FLOPs-sensitive bins forces the layers with larger FLOPs sensitivity to have fewer channels, thus reducing the search space at a fixed FLOPs.

Specifically, this paper divides channels into several groups/bins that have the same FLOPs-sensitivity and searches for promising architectures based on the divided groups. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate superiority over the considered methods. However, some important details regarding the proposed method are missing. My detailed comments are as follows.\n\nPositive points:\n1. Compared with the manually \ufb01xed weight sharing pattern, this paper proposes a locally free weight sharing strategy (CafeNet), which allows more freedom in the channel assignment of a sub-network.\n\n2. To reduce the size of the search space, this paper proposes to divide channels into several groups/bins (also called minimum searching unit) that have the same FLOPs-sensitivity.\n\n3.

If so, how to deal with this case when evaluating the sub-network?\n\n5. The experimental results are inconsistent with the descriptions.

Especially since the rise of graph neural networks (GNNs), the deep learning community has been developing solvers that derive solutions to NP-hard problems by learning the problem-specific solution structure. However, reproducing the results of these publications proves to be difficult. We make three contributions. First, we present an open-source benchmark suite for the NP-hard Maximum Independent Set problem, in both its weighted and unweighted variants. The suite offers a unified interface to various state-of-the-art traditional and machine learning-based solvers. Second, using our benchmark suite, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the popular guided tree search algorithm by Li et al. [NeurIPS 2018], testing various configurations on small and large synthetic and real-world graphs. By re-implementing their algorithm with a focus on code quality and extensibility, we show that the graph convolution network used in the tree search does not learn a meaningful representation of the solution structure, and can in fact be replaced by random values. Instead, the tree search relies on algorithmic techniques like graph kernelization to find good solutions. Thus, the results from the original publication are not reproducible. Third, we extend the analysis to compare the tree search implementations to other solvers, showing that the classical algorithmic solvers often are faster, while providing solutions of similar quality. Additionally, we analyze a recent solver based on reinforcement learning and observe that for this solver, the GNN is responsible for the competitive solution quality."

It is hard to draw conclusions on combinatorial optimization from one problem.\n- The paper focuses on a single work (Li et al., 2018) that the authors were unable to reproduce and a single work that showed promising results (Ahn et al.

A study of a larger sample of deep learning solutions would be useful to support claims about the value of GNNs, neural-guided tree search, or reinforcement learning for combinatorial optimization.\n- The result that specialized solvers and even classical solvers are often better than deep learning solutions, especially on larger problems, has been reported for other computational problems (e.g., TSP [1]). Ahn et al. [2020] already reported that KaMIS outperforms Li et al. [2018] and that reduction and local search lead to improvements. Further, other works have looked at generalization of GNNs (e.g., [2]).

                "content": "The paper conducts a thorough experimental evaluation of a line of work on \"deep-learning guided tree search in combinatorial optimization\". This line of work iterates on a relatively generic greedy-style algorithm for NP-Hard graph optimization problems; with a neural network -- trained on a training set of instances -- guiding the greedy decisions. The popularity of this approach is anchored in the premise of \"deep learning will help us solve NP-Hard problems.\n\nFindings of the experimental evaluation are the following:\n1) Some earlier work is not reproducible\n2) Traditional dedicated solvers are comparable or better; particularly on harder/larger problem instances\n3) Performance of data-driven methods barely changes when outputs of trained neural nets are replaced by random values (i.e. all the algorithmic power comes from explicit and traditional heuristical components) Strengths:\n\nThe empirical results of the paper have the potential to redirect (some) research in \"ML for combinatorial optimization\" to more fruitful directions in which it is indeed the learned components playing a vital role. I think this is fundamentally valuable.\n\nWeaknesses: \n\nI have multiple concerns regarding the presentation and methodology which I will list below. \n\n* Overall presentation\n\nFirst of all, Table 1 contains about 700 numbers none of which are legible on printed paper due to tiny font size (is it 3?). Given how strictly ML conferences force authors to respect font sizes, margins, and appropriate whitespace, I would almost think such a table merits a desk rejection. More importantly, even after zooming in, it is extremely hard for readers to navigate and draw meaningful conclusions from it. I suggest to a) decide on a subset of the most informative datasets (some are clearly too easy for all methods) and focus on that -- the rest can be in the appendix; b) similarly decide on the key subset of columns; surely the point isn't to compare all the heuristical components; c) This should win enough space to illustrate each of the main conclusions in a plot/table of its own (while displaying precisely the relevant information). d) Introducing a visual distinction between learning-based and classical method would be helpful.\n\nThe write-up assumes a lot of familiarity with tree-search methods and as a result, is uninviting even (!) to researchers from the wider MLxCombOpt community. I suggest the authors consider the following suggestions:\n\na) explaining tree-search basics in the main text\n\nb) explaining (some of) the heuristics in the main text -- it is important for the analysis of the results anyway.\n\nc) restructuring the related work (and introduction?) to categorize different ways ML is applied to NP-Hard combinatorial problems and explaining the place of \"tree-search\" in it (definitely add a discussion of learning to branch-and-bound as well as some details of (Nair 2021)). Categorizing by the degree of interaction between learned and algorithmic components is an option to consider. \n\nWith all of this in place, the paper would put itself in a position to frame its claims in much wider relevance (which I believe the claims deserve).\n\n* Confusion about the promise of DL for comb. opt.\n\nThe second paragraph of the introduction claims that learning-based approaches give a chance to learn to solve a *specific problem* (unlike Gurobi that doesn't make a distinction). I find this inaccurate. For one, there are obviously dedicated solvers to concrete problems; this feature isn't specific to DL. But mainly, the promise of DL, as I see it, is to learn solvers specialized to a *family of instances*. This view is well-motivated by industrial reality (e.g. Amazon's routing instances are almost the same every day) and it appears in the literature (see for example the introduction to (Khalil, 2017)).\n\nThe authors should be more explicit about evaluating the methods in a \"harder\" setup where the learned components are expected to generalize *across* families of instances (it seemed that training happens only on SATLIB). Evaluating the more favorable setting might also be interesting.\n\n* Treatment of Gurobi as a baseline\n\nThis paper has a unique chance to highlight a common issue with Gurobi comparisons. It has a lot of internal parameters that can be tuned to specific problems -- and in fact, they should, if other baselines are allowed to do it. Other than establishing the practice, it could further strengthen the points made by the authors.\n\n* Clarity about GPU utilization\n\nI assume that Gurobi and KaMIS do not utilize GPU whereas other methods do? Does rand use GPU? It seems it wouldn't need to. Given the massive computational advantage that 8 V100s give, the runtime comparisons should be very clear about it. Again, this clarity should go in favor of the main message: e.g. \"even with such computational advantage tree-search doesn't outperform traditional solvers\" or \"since tree search is comparable to rand; it is basically just a powerful GPU-friendly heuristical algorithm that is independent of any machine learning\". Despite the paper being purely experimental, its main point can have significant net-positive impact within the wider research area. Not only by casting doubt on the entire \"DL based tree-search\" but also by serving as a long-term warning -- claims about \"outperforming SOTA of classical combinatorial optimization\" can fall apart under proper experimental methodology.\n\n For this reason, I am comfortable disregarding the usual demands for technical novelty, beating benchmarks, or providing theory.\n\nHowever, in its current form, I do not believe the paper would realize its potential impact due to the issues listed above. I believe they require significant changes in the paper structure so I cannot, at this point, recommend acceptance."

                "content": "This paper proposes a software package for generating data and training/evaluation some ML and non-ML approaches for the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem in its both its unweighted and weighted versions. It is shown that a highly-cited method that combines supervised learning using a graph neural network (GCN) with a (complete) tree search does not actually need the GCN if the MIS instance is preprocessed appropriately using existing non-ML based codes. On the other hand, a recent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach for the same problem is shown to actually use its GCN\u2019s predictions, obtaining better results overall. Last, non-ML solvers such as KaMIS and Gurobi are shown to find better solutions in a short amount of time for most instance datasets, putting into question the potential for ML-based approaches in general for MIS. **Strengths**\n\n- Clarity: The paper is generally very well-written, although the presentation of the results can be improved substantially.\n- Motivation: Li et al.\u2019s paper is being cited and compared against in tens of papers yearly, and so understanding its limitations and apparently fundamental issues is useful for the community.\n- Reproducibility: The authors are very systematic and transparent in how they generate datasets, implement the various methods, and evaluate them. I can see their code becoming widely used and built on in the development of ML-based methods for MIS.\n\n**Weaknesses**\n\n1. Presentation of experimental results: Tables 1 and 2 should be part of the paper\u2019s appendix for sure, but you really need to find better ways of presenting those thousands of statistics in the main text. As things currently stand, the reader needs to zoom-in to read the numbers; there are so many columns that it\u2019s hard to track which one corresponds to which method or what the trends are in terms of best method for a given dataset. Additionally, please label the paragraphs of section 3.1 so that the reader can immediately understand which aspect of the results you\u2019re discussing. As things stand, I\u2019ve had to decipher which columns I should query in the tables to see what you\u2019re saying in the paragraphs of 3.1.\n\n2. Statistical metrics: The average optimality ratios and running times in Tables 1 and 2 are certainly indicative of some trends. However, some box plots of the distributions of the optimality ratios/running times might shed more light into the robustness of the methods. For instance, the running time average may be biased by outliers whereas a box plot factors that in. Combining this suggestion with the one above, you could consider moving the tables to the appendix and replacing them in the main text with two box plots per datasets, one for optimality ratio and another for running time. This way, the reader can visually compare different methods without having to zoom-in and read hundreds of numbers. Since this paper\u2019s contributions are largely software/empirical results, you can also consider performing statistical testing for each pair of methods; see the two-sided Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test for example.\n\n3. Datasets: Please consider additional datasets which may be a bit more standard for MIS papers, e.g.:\n- http://vlsicad.eecs.umich.edu/BK/Slots/cache/www.nlsde.buaa.edu.cn/~kexu/benchmarks/graph-benchmarks.htm\n- http://lcs.ios.ac.cn/~caisw/graphs.html\n\nIn particular, the DIMACS implementation challenge graphs have been used in the KaMIS paper for example, among others. Also, this very recent dataset of large-scale instances may be of interest (even if only to evaluate and not train): https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12623\n\n4. MIS heuristics and mathematical programming formulations: Please check Butenko\u2019s dissertation (Butenko, Sergiy. Maximum independent set and related problems, with applications. University of Florida, 2003.), particularly chapters 2-3 and the experimental results later on. The binary linear programming formulation you used with Gurobi is not the only one possible; there are quadratic formulations (see eq. (2.3) in Butenko) which may be easier to solve in practice than the linear one. Also please check the famous GRASP heuristic for MIS and consider implementing it: Feo, Thomas A., Mauricio GC Resende, and Stuart H. Smith. \"A greedy randomized adaptive search procedure for maximum independent set.\" Operations Research 42.5 (1994): 860-878.\n\n5. Where do your results leave us? I would\u2019ve expected you to identify datasets (existing or new) for which KaMIS and Gurobi underperform in some respect. Perhaps that is tricky; you\u2019ve tried many datasets (though there are more you could try as mentioned earlier) and the two solvers did very well. You might then want to consider other harder versions of MIS, for example the Generalized Independent Set Problem, see (Colombi, Marco, Renata Mansini, and Martin Savelsbergh. \"The generalized independent set problem: Polyhedral analysis and solution approaches.\" European Journal of Operational Research 260.1 (2017): 41-55.) and (Hosseinian, Seyedmohammadhossein, and Sergiy Butenko. \"Algorithms for the generalized independent set problem based on a quadratic optimization approach.\" Optimization Letters 13.6 (2019): 1211-1222.). In this variant, some edges may be \u201cpurchased\u201d and their endpoints may violate the independence requirement. This makes the problem much harder than MIS for integer programming solvers. Your paper should really push the community to advance the field.\n\n6. Solver parameter tuning as a baseline: Please consider adding a baseline in which KaMIS/Gurobi are \u201ctrained\u201d on the same datasets as the ML-based methods by tuning their parameters using off-the-shelf tools like SMAC (https://www.automl.org/automated-algorithm-design/algorithm-configuration/smac/). Such a baseline combines the best of both worlds in a sense: the stability and generality of these solvers with the potential benefits of leveraging the instance distribution.\n\nMinor comments:\n\n- page 8, \u201cOverall, we see that \u2026 cannot deal with some graphs\u201d, this is not true for Gurobi though, correct?  Overall, I like this paper and think it makes a solid contribution to the intersection between deep learning and combinatorial optimization. However, I think a paper that \u201cdebunks\u201d a highly-cited work should also establish convincing avenues for future research which are currently beyond the scope of (ML or non-ML) existing methods; I argue that this is missing at this stage. I would like to see the authors\u2019 responses to my questions and concerns before making a final decision, but am generally positive about this submission."

We would like to address your points individually. \n\n### Overall presentation\nWe received your criticism of the presentation and tried to improve it following your and the other reviewers\u2019 feedback. We\u2019ve moved the two tables into the appendix and included a small subset table for the main text. We\u2019ve further structured the evaluation text more clearly by labeling the paragraphs, and added some extra plots. \n\nRegarding the visual distinction, for the original table 1, this just were learning-based methods, and in the original table 2, we compared the full/default configurations of them to the classical solvers. Maybe this was a bit confusing, but as it just was 1-2 column(s) per solver in table 2, we hope it is sufficiently clear.\n\n> The write-up assumes a lot of familiarity with tree-search methods\n\nWe agree that the write-up assumes a lot of familiarity, and hence moved the textual description of the algorithm into the main text. Due to space constraints, the pseudo code has to stay within the Appendix. Unfortunately, the heuristics needed to stay in the appendix, to make some space for the plots that reviewer m13R suggested. We hope that using the text (and maybe a quick look into the pseudocode), the entry barrier for the paper is now a bit lower.\n\n### Related Work Restructuring\nThank you very much for that suggestion! Indeed, the related work discussion was not very strong until now. We\u2019ve integrated the related work section into section 2, and while doing that tried to discuss the different variants on how the algorithmic components and algorithms can interact and what the design space is (including branch-and-bound as well as Nair 2021). We hope that we now provide a much clearer introduction into the current state of the art. If you have any further suggestions for that, we are willing to include them for a final version.\n\n### Confusion about the promise of DL for comb. opt.\nWe agree we were confusing learning problem-specific solution structure and instance-specific solution structure. Thank you very much for pointing that out. We\u2019ve tried to make that more clear in the revised version, both in the introduction and the evaluation, where we discuss that the DGL/Intel-Treesearch neither learn the instance-specific structure (SATLIB) nor generalize beyond the training family.\n\n### Gurobi baseline tuning\nWhile we think it\u2019s not part of our main paper to evaluate parameter tuning for Gurobi, we agree it\u2019s an interesting experiment. Using Gurobi\u2019s internal optimization tool `grbtune`, we added another appendix section that discusses the impact of tuning Gurobi. For our use case, it shows that parameter tuning does not bring additional performance and Gurobi\u2019s defaults are sensible.\n\n### Clarity about GPU utilization\nIndeed, Gurobi and KaMIS are CPU-only, just as the randomized DGL-TreeSearch. Note that in the experiments we just used one GPU per experiment because even the multithreaded tree search was not able to even get close to maximum GPU utilization. Additionally, we ran a multithreaded tree search with 8 GPUs and see no impact on performance (which is explained by the non-GPU-boundedness of the tree search). We\u2019ve tried to make this more clear in the revised paper.\n\nThank you very much again for your feedback. We hope we addressed your points accordingly, and restructured the paper in a way that you now can comfortably make an acceptance decision. We are open for further feedback.\n\nKind regards,\nAuthors\n"

We would like to address your points individually. \n\n### Presentation and Metrics\nAs you\u2019ve suggested, we moved the long tables into the appendix and included a much smaller table for the main tree search results, focussing on two random graphs (ER, HRG), and a few real-world data sets. Furthermore, we\u2019ve followed your suggestion to label the paragraphs of the analysis. Thank you very much!\n\nWe\u2019ve added violin plots for some data sets comparing the different configurations, both for the tree searches and the other solvers. We think violin plots are more suitable than boxplots for our purposes here, and agree this is a valuable addition to the paper.\n\n### Datasets\nWe\u2019ve added the DIMACS implementation challenge to our evaluation. Thank you for making us aware. The other link and resources on the first link point to \"BHOSLIB\" which is equivalent to VC-BM in our paper. We added that name to the VC-BM subsection, to avoid future confusion.\nWe\u2019ve also included the Amazon MWIS dataset in our evaluation, at least on the smaller instances, as all solvers except Gurobi run into their limits on these graphs.\n\n### MIS heuristics\nAlthough we believe evaluating different variants for solving MIS with Gurobi is not the main focus of the paper, we added an additional appendix section that compares the linear formulation with the quadratic.\n\nRegarding the GRASP heuristic, we researched that algorithm and could not find any recent modern implementation (just a Fortran one), so we believe KaMIS to be the more widespread and modern heuristic solver. If you can point us to a modern (Python or C(++)) implementation, we would be willing to integrate it into the analysis, but we are not able to implement this algorithm within the timeframe for the discussion period in a way that would be fair, as we do not want to have some prototypical non-tested implementation that was built in a day. We hope you understand our decision here, and thank you very much for the pointer. In any case, we added GRASP to the related work section.\n\n### Generalized Independent Set\nWe agree that such a paper should push the community to advance the field and believe it would be a worthwhile addition to consider other versions of MIS (note that we already analyze the weighted variant, which makes the problem much harder, as vertices are not valued uniformly anymore). However, the related work we could find within the ML4CombOpt community does not target different MIS variants. With our paper, we wanted to make a first step towards a reproducible evaluation of the state of the art, and we are already at the limits of our conference submission. We agree that for a longer journal paper, it would be interesting to apply some solvers to other problems, but this would imply further engineering and we believe this to be out of scope for this paper. We added a discussion of this to the future work section and hope that our paper motivates the field to continue to push forward with a focus on rigorous empirical evaluation.\n\n### Gurobi tuning\nWhile we think it\u2019s not part of our main paper to evaluate parameter tuning for Gurobi, we agree it\u2019s an interesting experiment. Using `grbtune`, we added another appendix section that discusses the impact of tuning Gurobi. For our use case, it shows that parameter tuning does not bring additional performance and Gurobi\u2019s defaults are sensible.\n\nRegarding your minor comment, our formulation was a bit confusing as \u201calgorithmic solvers\u201d was referring to KaMIS only. We made it more clear in the revised version.\n\nAfter addressing the technical problems you mentioned as best as we could within the limited timeframe of the discussion period, the question still stands whether a \u201cdebunking\u201d paper should establish conving avenues for future research, as you write. With this paper, it is our goal to show how important rigorous empirical evaluation of newly proposed methods, especially in a rapidly evolving field such as machine learning, is. While we agree that for example other MIS variants would be interesting, we believe that taking the step back and check whether the assumption \u201cusing ML, we can efficiently solve MIS\u201d as Li et al. are often cited is correct, already advances the field a lot and lays the ground for future research on these methods. A formal analysis on why it actually is difficult to learn a solution structure here would be very insightful for future work. For such a \u201cdebunking\u201d benchmarking paper, we believe it\u2019s out of scope to additionally propose a novel method that then the next steps build up upon. But we understand your point and hope that our improvements, clarifications and additional evaluations will guide your tree search for an acceptance decision :-).\n\nThank you very much again, we really believe your feedback to have greatly improved our paper. Please let us know if this addresses your concerns for a final decision.\n\nKind regards,\nAuthors"

We would like to address your points individually.\n\n> All experiments are done on one problem type, MIS, while there is a lot of work on other graph-related problems such as TSP, VRP, etc.\n\nWe agree that for a final verdict on general combinatorial optimization, other graph problems like the ones that you mention should be evaluated. However, the weighted variant of MIS that we consider already makes the problem a lot harder, as vertices are not valued uniformly anymore. While Li et al. consider other problems, they are not vastly different at their core (e.g., Minimum Vertex Cover is just a flipped Maximum Independent Set), compared to TSP/VRP vs MIS. Due to time and space constraints we are not able to include detailed analyses of TSP/VRP architectures and we believe that it would be a bit out of scope for this paper; however, we made it more clear in the paper why we focus on MIS and added to the conclusion that future analyses on other problems, like TSP, should be made. Additionally, in Section 2, we additionally discus different architectures for ML-based combinatorial optimization, and discussed the TSP architecture by Kool et al. [2].\n\n> A study of a larger sample of deep learning solutions would be useful to support claims about the value of GNNs, neural-guided tree search, or reinforcement learning for combinatorial optimization.\n\nWe agree that adding more solvers to the benchmarking suite and analysis would provide more insights. However, the most important claims we make in the paper target specifically the Intel-TreeSearch/DGL-TreeSearch. It is not our goal to evaluate all approaches of DL4CompOpt that are out there; we believe this would be more fitting for a longer journal article, as space and scope of a conference submission are limited. Furthermore, we are not certain which solvers we would be missing. Notably, there is S2V-DQN [1] as a reinforcement learning solver, but Learning what to Defer has proven to be better than it in every aspect, so it is not included in our analysis due to space constraints and we have more space for the detailed tree search analysis.\n\n> The result that specialized solvers and even classical solvers are often better than deep learning solutions, especially on larger problems, has been reported for other computational problems\n\nThank you very much for making us aware of these papers. During the restructuring of the related work discussions that another reviewer suggested, we have added them to our related work and evaluation discussions and made it more clear that Ahn et al. in the LwD paper also analyze KaMIS.\n\n> While providing open-source benchmark suite, including implementations of several popular approaches, is important, as far as I understand this suite is primarily a collection of existing problems and randomly-generated graphs and does not introduce new benchmark datasets. I am not sure this is an important contribution of the work.\n\nOur suite provides a very comprehensive collection of standard real-world, random, and synthetically made hard graph instances on which the MIS problem is solved. We think the core contribution of a benchmarking suite is exactly that: Creating such a central collection of datasets, unifying the solvers -- which often are just available in a \u201cresearch-code\u201d status -- under a single interface, and providing the results. We do not think that introducing a new MIS benchmarking dataset is within the scope of our paper, especially because focusing on the existing ones enables comparison with other works. Often, there are papers published just for the release of a single new benchmark dataset. Based on another reviewer\u2019s feedback, we added the DIMACS and Amazon datasets to the paper.\n\nAgain, thank you for helping to improve the paper! We hoped we addressed the points that we believe to be within the scope of this conference submission, and made it clear why we think that targeting more problems like TSP does not fit into the scope of this submission. Furthermore, if there is any other solver you are missing that would provide additional insights, we would be grateful for a pointer.

Next, the paper presents investigates if these results are reproducible by (1) running the publicly available implementation after fixes; and (2) re-implementing the algorithm as described in the paper and documentation. None of these versions replicates the reported performance. The paper also presents a benchmark suite to make comparison of this task easier.    The primary strength of the paper is it is opening up an important direction towards scientific accuracy. Citation counts often work as a proxy for the perceived importance of a paper. A paper with 200+ citations in less than 3 years of publication is thus likely to be considered as highly influential in the field. Through re-looking at the claimed results, this paper makes a significant contribution towards a research philosophy that seeks to validate influential papers. \n\nThe benchmark data set is an important contribution and the detailed results presented in Table 2 can immensely benefit future performance comparisons. \n\nThe writing of the paper is excellent and the paper and the literature review is extensive.  \n\nThat said, one potential risk in this paper is what if the current implementation is wrong and indeed the guided tree search is effective?  Our field is producing papers at a fast rate. Reviewers can provide scientific checks and balances only up to a certain level.

If the inner\nproduct is too big, then the projection of the intersection between the facets is in the singularity set.\nSo this work doesn\u2019t involve any linear programming at all.\n\n----------------------------\nQ2: Could you explain why not using the following substitute: Step 1. Fit an auto-encoder just as\nyou did in the paper and get an empirical distribution \u03bd. Step 2. Fit a Gaussian mixture model on \u03bd\nand do model selection over # clusters. Step 3. Sample from the Gaussian mixture model to generate\nfresh images.\n\nAnswer: We thank Reviewer #1 for the suggestions. The proposed approach is inspiring, but it has\npotential drawbacks:\n\u2022 If the empirical distribution has only one mode, but the support is concave, then the proposed\nmethod still can not avoid generating unrealistic samples.\n\u2022 If the empirical distribution has multiple modes, the resulting Gaussian mixture will fill\nthe gaps among the modes, therefore the proposed method still can not avoid generating\nunrealistic samples (mode mixture).\n\u2022 Fitting Gaussian mixture itself is expensive and without further assumptions, the convergence\nof the GMM fitting cannot be guaranteed.\n\nIn order to show the above claims, we did the following experiments: firstly we fit the 60K latent code\nof MNIST dataset by GMM, with the number of modes set to be 10, 30, 100. Then t-SNE is used to\nvisualize the data. The blue crosses are the generated data by the GMM model and the green circles\nare the training data. In the anonymous website https://drive.google.com/file/d/12HbiQNAoTpxnk-h10LY0O90j8QhSIKqw/view?usp=sharing, we provide the results: Fig. (a)(b)(c) show the generation results of GMM,\nfrom which we can see that there are huge number of generated samples in the regions among the\nmodes.

Besides, the paper does not involve an\nadversarial training module. So I will not treat it as a satisfactory improvement over GAN. Overall,\nthe proposed problem in GAN indeed exists. But the solution seems to deviate from the goal the\npaper aim to achieve.\n\nAnswer: The real goal of this work is to tackle mode collapse and mode mixture problems in general generative models, not only for GANs. Our work targets at analysis and improvement of generators in generic generative models, including VAEs and GANs. In fact, generators in these models tend to map a unimodal Gaussian to the complex data distribution, which will inevitably encounter the singularity problem proposed in our work. We thank the reviewer #1 for pointing out the ambiguity of our motivation. We have revised our abstract and introduction parts, which illustrate that the proposed AE-OT model solves the discontinuity problems encountered by both GANs and VAEs. Actually, in the original version of our paper, we have reviewed all the DNN based generative models in the related work part, and made comparisons with GANs, VAEs and other generated models in the experiment part. \nAccording to Figali\u2019s Fields medal work, it shows the intrinsic reason for mode collapse is the discontinuity of transportation map, caused by the concavity of the support of the data distributions. Based on this theoretic discovery, the AE-OT model is proposed. This model is not a conventional GAN model, but a novel generative model that exactly solves the main problems we are targeting at.\n"

                "content": "\n----------------------------\nQ1:  I have some doubts about moving from the \"semi-discrete OT map\" to the piece-wise linear extension.   The illustration in Fig. 3,  and implicit in all the explanation charts is the fact that discontinuity can be found by a linear separation. This seems to be an extremely simplifying assumption, which leads to not so great visual results from the paper.\n\nAnswer: Here we want to clarify that singular set detection is *piece-wise linear* separation, rather than *linear* separation. In Fig. 3(a), the singular set (shown in red lines) is illustrated by a piece-wise linear curve. Also, Fig. 6 of the appendix shows another example with the numerically computed singular set (also piece-wise linear) by our method, and it is much more curved and complicated.\n\n----------------------------\nQ2: Although the numerical results seems promising, I feel that fewer images, but larger in size, and analysis of mode collapse phenomenon in real images would have been much better.\n\nAnswer:  As shown in the the last paragraph of Section 4.1, we conducted experiments of mode collapse on real images like stacked MNIST and CelebA on Section C.3 and C.4 of the appendix.\n\n----------------------------\nQ3:  Singular set detection seems to be the most tricky part in this paper, the Simplex projection assumption, renders this part not that tricky, but that is where I feel the biggest doubt about this paper lies.\n\nAnswer: (1) There is no simplex projection assumption in our paper. In fact, Fig.3(a) illustrates the Brenier potential and the corresponding power diagram. The upper hyperplane envelope in top of Fig.3(a) is the graph of Brenier potential, and the bottom of Fig. 3(a) shows the source domain of the Brenier potential, expressed as a cell decomposition structure. Each facet in the image of Brenier potential corresponds to a cell in the source domain (\u2126), and the ridges on the image of Brenier potential corresponds to edges of cells in the source domain.\n\n(2) In the image of the Brenier potential, the \"sharp ridges\" are composed of the edges where the angles between the corresponding pairs of adjacent facets are large (as shown in Fig.3(a)). In fact, the normal of a facet n= (p_1, p_2,..., p_d, \u22121) actually corresponds to a latent code y= (p_1, p_2,..., p_d). And the large angle between two adjacent facets means that the distance between the corresponding latent codes is large.  This often happens when the codes come from different modes.  Thus, the singular set, or equivalently the \"sharp ridges\" gives the information about different modes.\n\n(3) Singular set detection is proposed in our paper for the following reason. Firstly, the singular set is totally decided by the semi-discrete OT map, or equivalently, the Brenier potential (Fig.  3(a)). Secondly, the image of the semi-discrete OT map itself is the given discrete latent code, thus we extend it with a piece-wise linear manner, so that the extended OT map can be used to *generate new codes* (Fig. 3(b)). Thirdly, the samples around the singular set will be mapped to the gaps among the modes by our extended OT map and cause the mode mixture problem, thus the singular detection is needed. Finally, given a sample x, if it falls around the singular set (checked by Alg. 2), we just don\u2019t use it to generate new latent code.\n\n\n"

                "content": "\n----------------------------\nQ4: Singular set detection seems to be the most tricky part in this paper, which should have been explained further.\n\nAnswer: In the following, we justify our algorithm using the theoretic works summarized in the following book:\nFigalli, A. (2017). The Monge\u2013Amp\u00e8re equation and its applications.\n\nAccording to Brenier\u2019s theorem, the optimal transportation map T is the gradient of the convex Brenier potential u, and u satisfies the Monge-Amp\u00e9re equation.\nIn his book, the Fields medalist Figalli proved the existence and the uniqueness of the solution to the\nMonge-Ampere equation in Chapter 2, where he used Alexandrov\u2019s approach:\n1. Approximate the data distribution \u03bd to a sequence Dirac distributions \u03bdn, such that the sequence of {\u03bd_n} weakly converges to \u03bd;\n2. For each Dirac measure \u03bd_n, there exists an Alexandrov\u2019s solution u_n, which is exactly the discrete Brenier potential in our paper;\n3. The weak solutions {u_n} converges to the real solution u, u is C^1 almost everywhere, except at the singular set.\n\nOur Semi-Discrete OT algorithm is completely equivalent to Alexandrov\u2019s solution. In fact, the proof\nin Figalli\u2019s book is not constructive, (Alexandrov\u2019s original proof is based on Algebraic topology), which doesn\u2019t induce an computational algorithm. Therefore, the theorem 2 in the Appendix gives a variational framework to explicitly compute the discrete Brenier potential. By Figalli\u2019s work, the discrete Brenier potential {u_n} converges to the smooth Brenier potential, which is C^1 except at the singular set. The piece-wise linear map in Fig.3(a) converges to the real optimal transportation map.\n\nThe singular set is the non-differentiable points (only C^0 but not C^1) of the Brenier potentials, namely the ridges of the graph of u. This ridge structure becomes prominent and well-preserved in\nthe process of approximating u by piece-wise linear polyhedra {u_n} in Fig.3(a).\n\nCompared to Fig.3, Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 in the appendix gives better illustration for the singularity. The\noriginal version of Fig. 6 is given by Figalli as the Fig. 3.2 in the following article,\nFigalli, A. (2010). Regularity properties of optimal maps between nonconvex domains in the plane.\nCommunications in Partial Differential Equations, 35(3), 465-479.\n\nWe can see that the singular set has complicated geometric and topological structures, which can not\nbe captured by linear separation, but still can be found by *piece-wise linear approximation*. In\nfact, the optimal transport map shown in Fig. 6 is numerically computed by our algorithm, and the\nsingular set is piece-wise linear, approximating the singular set in the smooth case (shown as Fig. 3.2\nin the above mentioned article).\n\nNext we show that the singular set structure of the smooth Brenier potential is well preserved by\nour SDOT map. From chapter 2 in Figalli\u2019s book, we know that the piece-wise linear functions un\n(discrete Brenier potential) converges to the real smooth Brenier potential u, which is C^1\neverywhere except at the singular points. Therefore the graph of the smooth Brenier potential has ridges, these ridge structure are well preserved during the piece-wise linear approximation by the discrete Brenier\npotential. \n\nTherefore, singularity detection boils down to locate the ride structure of the graph of the discrete\nBrenier potential, which is a convex polyhedron. The ridge on a convex polyhedron can be easily\nfound by computing the angles between each pair of adjacent facets (dihedral angles for 2D case).\nBecause the discrete Brenier potential is convex, its projection induces a power diagram, each cell is\nconvex. The dual of this power diagram gives the power Delaunay triangulation of training samples\n(y_i\u2019s) (Fig. 2 of the following article). This geometric interpretation of semi-discrete OT doesn\u2019t\nrequire the linear separation assumption. The relation among discrete Brenier potential, power\ndiagram and power Delaunay triangulation is explained in details in\nGu, X., Luo, F., Sun, J., & Yau, S. T. (2016).

We will follow the reviewer\u2019s suggestion to make our claims\nmore moderate.\n\n----------------------------\nQ2: This is just a suggestion.

All these algorithms are different, and Newton\u2019s\nmethod does not imply convergence results for gradient descent. I don\u2019t see how Thm 3 is relevant.\n\nAnswer: According to the variational framework of semi-discrete optimal transportation map,\ntheorem 2, the computation of OT map is reduced to a convex optimization. Hence both gradient\ndescend and Newton\u2019s method converge. We will modify Thm 3 accordingly. Furthermore, this work\nfocuses on gradient descend method, in the future work, we will explore Newton\u2019s method as well.\n\n----------------------------\nQ4: This is a simple doubt.

I wonder if using a simpler approach through\noptimization for nosmooth problems (such as Moreau envelopes or proximal methods) could resolve\nthis issue? In the negative case, why not?\n\nAnswer: Although the OT map is discontinuous, and the Brenier potential is non-differentiable, the \nenergy to be optimized is C^2 in terms of h. Therefore, in the current work, for the optimization\npurpose it is unnecessary to use Moreau envelope or proximal methods. Specifically, the convex\nenergy E(h) we aim to optimize is differentiable with respect to h. With the optimal h, the OT map\ncan be induced. Therefore for the optimization, we actually do not need smoothing techniques to carry\nout the optimization. Secondly, the non-differentiability of Brenier\u2019s potiential uh(x) is considered\nwith respect to x given the optimal h. This is independent of the optimization process.\n\n----------------------------\nQ5: Some Minor comments: 1. Define OT in the abstract (Optimal Transportation?) 2.

The modifications made to the original algorithm are well-motivated and clearly explained. The empirical studies are comprehensive and show that QTRAN++ outperforms several baselines in data efficiency and final performance across a variety of domains.\n\n### Negatives\n\nThe algorithmic contribution of the paper is relatively minor, as it only makes simple modifications to an existing algorithm. It would be useful to see experiments on similar domains to those addressed in the original QTRAN paper to demonstrate that QTRAN++ retains the benefits of QTRAN in non-monotonic factorizable environments.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the positives and negatives, I would rate this paper as 3.5 out of 5. While the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of cooperative multi-agent learning, the algorithmic contribution is relatively minor. However, the comprehensive empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modifications.\n\nOverall, I would recommend accepting this paper, but with the suggestion that the authors provide more experiments on similar domains to those addressed in the original QTRAN paper to further demonstrate the benefits of QTRAN++.\n\n### Minor issues\n\n* Typo: Page 6, \"affluent\" should be \"influential\"\n* In Figure 3, some results seem to be not converged yet.

                "content": "QTRAN is a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm capable of learning the largest class of joint-action value functions up to date. However, despite its strong theoretical guarantee, it has shown poor empirical performance in complex environments, such as Starcraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC). In this paper, we identify the performance bottleneck of QTRAN and propose a substantially improved version, coined QTRAN++. Our gains come from (i) stabilizing the training objective of QTRAN, (ii) removing the strict role separation between the action-value estimators of QTRAN, and (iii) introducing a multi-head mixing network for value transformation. Through extensive evaluation, we confirm that our diagnosis is correct, and QTRAN++ successfully bridges the gap between empirical performance and theoretical guarantee. In particular, QTRAN++ newly achieves state-of-the-art performance in the SMAC environment. The code will be released."

                "content": "### Summary and claims\n\nThis work proposes a MARL (multi-agent reinforcement learning) algorithm.\nIn the MARL setting, multiple agents have to make choices based on independent information to maximize a common objective. An existing algorithm in this space is QTRAN.\nThe authors propose several modifications to QTRAN: changing the architecture, adding two additional constraints to the loss function and also allowing gradients to flow from the QTRAN objective into the \"true\" action-value estimator.\nThe claims of the paper are:\n1) QTRAN++ achieves better performance than QTRAN\n2) The modifications introduced stabilize training compared to QTRAN\n\nIt took me some time to fully understand all of the components that go into QTRAN++ and I find the complexity of the overall algorithm pretty surprising, especially considering that other algorithms in this space are as simple as \"add up all the Q values of the individual agents\".\nI think the proposed changes consist of:\n - Rather than directly training action-value networks, a QMIX-like hypernet approach is used\n - The network that estimates the \"true\" (combined) action-value is implemented through what the authors call a \"semi-monotonic mixing network\", which is the sum of a non-monotonic (regular) hypernet and a monotonic hypernet as used in QMIX. This seems pretty arbitrary. Isn't the original idea behind QTRAN that this would accurately track the true values?\n - In QTRAN the separate network that aggregates the Q values of the individual agents is trained to track the \"true\" action-value. In QTRAN++ this is done through multiple hypernetworks (the authors call these \"heads\").\n - The loss function is modified to impose two additional constraints on the transforming value function.\n - Gradients are now also backpropagated from the \"tracking loss\" into the \"true\" action-value estimator, which makes it somewhat unclear what it is actually representing.\n\n### Relation to prior work\n\nThe paper is positioned sufficiently with respect to prior work. I've noticed that there is a larger section on related work in the appendix. I'm not sure what the purpose of moving the related work into the appendix is, especially if some of the papers mentioned there are not actually related to the work presented in this paper. I think it would be good to try to move as much as possible of that section into the main text, leaving out prior work that is not sufficiently related.\nSome of the additions in QTRAN++ seem very similar to ideas proposed in QMIX, but this is not directly acknowledged as far as I can tell. It would be good to point out which parts of the architecture come from QMIX.\n\n### Are the claims supported?\n\nThe experiments presented in the paper are reasonably thorough and show that\nQTRAN++ consistently outperforms QTRAN on the tasks that were tested. SMAC (StarCraft Multiagent Challenge) is a nontrivial benchmark, so I would agree that claim 1) has been shown sufficiently. But I'm not sure whether the ablation studies are thorough enough to really demonstrate that all of the components of the (rather complex) proposed algorithm are really needed.\n\nThe authors often make claims about improved stability and other properties of the algorithm throughout the paper, but these are not supported by any empirical evidence. If the authors want to claim that QTRAN++ outperforms QTRAN because of a specific mechanism then it would be good to provide some sort of empirical evidence or proof (the proof in appendix A doesn't count since it doesn't make any statements about stability). Therefore I think that claim 2) is currently not well supported and it would be good to either support it better or soften the statements in the paper to make statements in the form of \"we believe that the algorithm has improved stability\".\n\n### Presentation and clarity\n\nThe paper is reasonably clear and understandable. There are some cases where incorrect grammar or word choice made a sentence difficult to understand. For example the choice of \"affluent\" to describe a class of estimators. It would be good to address cases like this to improve the clarity of the paper.\n\n### Conclusions\n\nThe main claim of the paper (that QTRAN++ is an improvement over QTRAN) has been demonstrated sufficiently. But the high complexity of the approach (with several additions to the algorithm feeling somewhat arbitrary) and the fact that the paper \"merely\" presents an upgrade to QTRAN could be potential arguments against accepting it.\n\n\n### *Edit after author comments:*\n\nI have read the author comments and the latest paper revision. The authors have noticeably improved the clarity of the paper in several places and adjusted their claims about the stability of the algorithm, and the improved ablation studies are appreciated. Unfortunately, after thinking it through very carefully and despite the author comments, I have not been able to understand some aspects of the model, for example why gradients from the tracking loss are backpropagated into the value function that is supposed to track the \"true\" action-values. Several parts of the architecture seem to have a complicated dual purpose, which makes it difficult to understand what is going on and why the model is performing better. I suspect that other readers might also encounter similar issues, which makes it difficult for me to raise my rating. I've decided to leave the rating at 6 (marginal accept)."

The paper claims superior perfromance gains compared to previous methods on the Starcraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) environment.\n\n### Strengths\n+ The ideas proposed to improve the previous QTRAN (or might be applied to other MARL algorithms as well) seems novel and general.\n+ The authors perform comprehensive ablation studies for different components they proposed.\n+ The empirical performance on the SMAC benchmark is better and more stable across different runs.\n+ The writing is clear and easy to follow.\n\n### Weaknesses\n- Only one environment is evaluated, which might not be that convincing. It would be good to see more results on different benchmarks.\n- In Figure 3, some results seem to be not converged yet.

                "title": "QTRAN++ is a good improvement for QTRAN, but the expectation of the advanced version of QTRAN is higher than in 2019.",
                "content": "This paper provides good improvements that make QTRAN more practical and can be applied to problems other than matrix games. Since QTRAN is a significant improvement for value-based multi-agent reinforcement learning after QMIX, the practical implementation of QTRAN is expected for a long time in the community. However, after the publication of QTRAN, especially in 2020, some other works have explored the question of how to extend QMIX to the full IGM function class. Due to these works (QPLEX is the major concern, given that weighted-QMIX has been compared in the experiments), the expectation of the advanced version of QTRAN is higher than before. I have several concerns regarding several core contributions of QTRAN++.\n\nQTRAN++ relies heavily on the true joint action-value function. (1.1) However, learning joint action-value functions is not an adorable choice in multi-agent problems. (1.2) To ease the training and representation of joint action-value functions, the authors condition $Q_{jt}$ on individual q values and use a semi-monotonic structure. However, it is difficult to tell the contribution of the monotonic part. It has been shown that monotonic functions can not represent some Q-values. Why should this part be included? I expect that I can find the answer from ablation studies, but on two out of three scenarios, FC-QTRAN++ is very similar to QTRAN++. The authors can provide a more serious discussion of this part to make their paper stronger.\n\nAbout the training of $Q_{tran}^{i}$. I have two questions about the training of this value function. (2.1) When training $Q_{tran}^{i}$, whether local utility function of agent $j$ ($q_j$ using the notation from the paper) is updated? (2.2) The training scheme is a midpoint between VDN and QMIX, which is similar to an attention mechanism that has been explored in multi-agent value decomposition settings. The formulation is quite different from previous papers (DOP [Wang et al., 2020] and REFIL [Iqbal et al. 2020]), but based on the results from these previous work, I think the multi-head structure may not improve the performance. Although the authors use a matrix game to illustrate their idea, which I appreciate, I can hardly tell whether this example is specially designed. I was expecting a convincing ablation study on SMAC, but I do not find them sufficient: (1) The authors did not record how many random seeds did they test, and SMAC tasks are typically sensitive to random seeds. (2) The gap between QTRAN and QTRAN++ is not significant. If the authors can provide results with more random seeds on more maps, I will consider revising my rating.\n\nMy last concern is about QPLEX, as cited by the authors. Similar to QTRAN, QPLEX provides full expressivity for the IGM function class. Nevertheless, the implementation of QPLEX seems to be much more lightweight than QTRAN++. Since QPLEX has provided codes that can be freely tested on the SMAC benchmark, I was wondering why the authors cited this paper but did not compare to it. At least, a detailed discussion of the differences can make the contribution of QTRAN++ clearer.\n\n** A minor concern about experiments.\nIt seems that the authors are using an older version of QMIX. In the latest version, QMIX can achieve a win rate pf 80% on MMM2. This fact is unknown for many, because the journal version of QMIX reports the same win rate as in this paper.\n\n[Wang et al., 2020] Wang, Y., Han, B., Wang, T., Dong, H. and Zhang, C., 2020.

The reported performance is not consistent with those reported in the SMAC benchmark paper (see Figure 4,5,6 in [1]) and QPLEX paper (Figure 5,8,19 in [2]). Moreover, I also evaluate the available GitHub codes of baselines on my own, which is consistent with [1,2].\n\nUsing results in [1,2], QTRAN++ significantly underperforms the baselines on the StarCraft II benchmark tasks. Moreover, the paper claims that it uses the standard StarCraft II benchmark, the latest version of SC2, and the default baseline codes.\n\nDue to these concerns, I tend to lower my rating.\n\n[1] Samvelyan M, Rashid T, de Witt C S, et al.

                "content": "Thank you very much for sharing the concern. \n\nWe first clarify your statement: our proposal to use a semi-monotonic structure is not to **learn** the action-value functions efficiently in the monotonic class (for the given environment). Instead, we designed our semi-monotonic network for being efficiently **learned by** the (transformed) action-value functions in the monotonic class. \n\nWe also verify that the semi-monotonic network does not over-exploit the fact that monotonic functions are sufficient for most maps in the SMAC benchmark. To this end, we refer to Figure 4 of our revised paper; here, our QTRAN++ outperforms its variant without the semi-monotonic network (FC-QTRAN++) in the maps where the monotonic functions are not sufficient, i.e., MMM2 (negative) and 10m_vs_11m. We consider the monotonic functions to be insufficient for such maps since the (monotonic) QMIX performs considerably worse than the (non-monotonic) QTRAN for solving them in Figure 3. \n\nTo further alleviate your concern on the semi-monotonic network, we considered an additional task, i.e., multi-domain Gaussian squeeze (MGS) benchmark [8], to compare QTRAN++ and its variant without the semi-monotonic network (FC-QTRAN++). The MGS benchmark is meaningful since it is specifically designed to show the case where the monotonicity functions are insufficient, e.g., QMIX performs worse than QTRAN. We report the corresponding result in Figure 8 of the revised paper. Here, one observes how QTRAN++ performs at least as well as FC-QTRAN++. This again verifies how our semi-monotonic network does not hurt the performance of QTRAN++ for general tasks.  \n\n**References**  \n[8] Son et al.

Is this generally good for all tasks apart from SC2 (explained in detail in the next paragraph)?\n\nIn the revised paper, I think the authors mean that, for those action-value functions in the monotonic class, such a structure may learn efficiently. Authors show more experimental results to show the superiority of the semi-monotonic structure, which I appreciate. However, this raises a further concern: whether the proposed structure bypasses the difficulty of estimating joint Q values by exploiting the fact that monotonic functions are sufficient for most maps in the SMAC benchmark? (some recent papers support this fact) The monotonic part may hurt performance on other tasks like Predator and Prey. "

The authors did not record how many random seeds they test. Authors can provide results with more random seeds on more maps.**\n\nThank you for the suggestion. To address your concern, we extended our ablation studies from 3 maps to 10 maps. We report the experimental results in Figure 4 of the revised paper. In the figure, one can observe how the multi-head component provides a concrete improvement to QTRAN++. To be specific, QTRAN++ performs significantly better than Mix-QTRAN++ (QTRAN++ without the multi-head component) in the 5m_vs_6m and 5m_vs_6m (negative) scenarios and performs at least as good as Mix-QTRAN++ for the other eight scenarios.\n\nFurthermore, we recorded that we use five random seeds for all the experiments in Section 4.1 of our paper (before revision). If you find this number of random seeds insufficient, we will be happy to run more experiments and increase the number of random seeds.\n\n---\n\n**7. The gap between QTRAN and QTRAN++ is not significant.**\n\nWe do believe that the gap between QTRAN and QTRAN++ is significant. As one can see in Figure 3 of our (original or revised) paper, QTRAN++ outperforms QTRAN for all the scenarios. Especially, QTRAN performs the worst among the baselines in five out of ten scenarios, i.e., MMM2, 3s5z, 3s5z (negative), 3s_vs_5z, 3s_vs_5z (negative). In contrast, QTRAN++ achieves the best performance for all ten scenarios.\n\n---\n\n**8. I was wondering why the authors did not compare with QPLEX. A detailed discussion of the differences between QPLEX and QTRAN++ can make the contribution clearer.**\n\nThank you for the suggestion. To address your concern, we additionally considered QPLEX (a concurrent submission at ICLR 2021, https://openreview.net/forum?id=Rcmk0xxIQV) as a baseline in Figure 3. One can observe how our QTRAN++ outperforms QPLEX for four scenarios, i.e., MMM2, 10m_vs_11m (negative), 5m_vs_6m (negative), 3z_vs_5z, and performs at least as good as QPLEX for the other six scenarios.\n\nTo further incorporate your suggestion, we discuss the algorithmic difference between QPLEX and QTRAN++. As you mentioned, QPLEX is similar to QTRAN++ since it removes the restriction on the true action-value estimator. However, they use different regularization for achieving this goal. To be specific, QTRAN++ imposes an additional loss function between the true and the transformed action-value estimators. In contrast, QPLEX introduces a structural constraint: the true action-value estimator is expressed as a summation of utility functions and a non-positive advantage estimator. A more detailed discussion is incorporated in Appendix B of our revised paper.\n\n---\n\n**9. It seems that the authors are using an older version of QMIX. In the latest version, QMIX can achieve a win rate of 80% on MMM2.**\n\nAfter careful inspection, we checked that our version of QMIX is identical to your suggested version. We hypothesize that the performance gap comes from different exploration hyperparameters and version of Starcraft II (performance of the algorithms may be sensitive to the version of Starcraft II as stated in [7]). To be specific, we use the same experimental setting across all algorithms for a fair comparison. Especially, we use the setting employed by the previous state-of-the-art work [4] to make the comparison more competitive. To incorporate your comment, we revised Appendix D of our paper by adding this discussion accordingly.\n\n---\n\n**References**  \n[1] Sunehag et al.

We are grateful for all the positive comments: providing a practical improvement for the theoretically important algorithm (by you and R4), strong empirical performance (by R1, R3, and R4), novel and general ideas (by R1), and clear writing (by R1 and R3). In the revised manuscript, we have substantially updated or newly added (Section 2, Section 3, Figure 3, Figure 4, Appendix B, D, E, F) according to the initial reviews and colored them red. In the following, we address your comments one by one.\n\n---\n\n**1. The true joint action-value estimator is not an adorable choice in multi-agent problems.**\n\nWe agree that using the true joint action-value estimator is not adorable for some multi-agent frameworks, e.g., VDN [1] or QMIX [2], since the agent-wise policies cannot be extracted from the estimator. However, as we explained in Section 3, our QTRAN++ resolves this issue by extracting the agent-wise policies from the transformed action-value estimator: a projection of the true joint action-value estimator into a space of decentralizable functions. Note that QTRAN [3] and Weighted QMIX [4] also used the same approach to use the true joint action-value estimator. In our revised paper, we further clarified this point at the beginning of Section 3.\n\n---\n\n**2. It is difficult to tell the contribution of the monotonic part of the true joint action-value estimator. It has been shown that monotonic functions cannot represent some Q-values.**\n\nAs we explained in Section 3, the performance of QTRAN++ depends on the quality of the transformed action-value estimator for approximating the true action-value estimator. The monotonic part helps improve such quality since it implicitly biases the true action-value estimator towards being learned easily by a monotonic function, i.e., the transformed action-value estimator. In our revised paper, we further clarified this point in Section 3.2.\n\nFurthermore, although we agree on the limited representative power of the monotonic part in our true action-value estimator, our true action-value estimator does not suffer from such a limitation since it additionally has a non-monotonic network as a component.\n\n---\n\n**3. In two out of three scenarios in the ablation studies, FC-QTRAN++ is very similar to QTRAN++.**\n\nWe do believe that QTRAN++ demonstrates a concrete improvement over FC-QTRAN++ in our ablation studies; it outperforms FC-QTRAN++ significantly for the last of three scenarios, i.e., 3s_vs_5z. To further alleviate your concern, we refer to our revised paper where we increased the number of scenarios from three to ten. In Figure 4, one can observe a more concrete improvement: QTRAN++ outperforms FC-QTRAN++ for three scenarios, i.e., 10m_vs_11m, MMM2 (negative), 3s_vs_5z, and performs at least as good as FC-QTRAN++ for other seven scenarios.\n\n---\n\n**4. When training $i$-th head of the transformed action-value estimator, is the utility function of $j$-th agent updated?**\n\nYes, we update the utility function of $j$-th agent when training $i$-th head of the transformed action-value estimator. In our revised paper, we further clarify this point in Appendix D.\n\n---\n\n**5. Based on the results from DOP [5] and REFIL [6], I think the multi-head structure may not improve the performance.**\n\nAs explained in Section 3.2, our multi-head structure improves the performance of our QTRAN++ by alleviating the issues arising from partial observability. To be specific, it regularizes the agents to rely less on the underlying state information that is not observable during the execution of QTRAN++. While prior works such as DOP and REFIL use multi-head structures similar to ours, their motivations are quite different. DOP aims to reduce the variance in training agent-wise actors using a multi-head critic.

In the revised manuscript, we have substantially updated or newly added (Section 2, Section 3, Figure 3, Figure 4, Appendix B, D, E, F) according to the initial reviews and colored them red. In the following, we address your comments one by one.\n\n---\n\n**1. Using a semi-monotonic mixing network for the true action-value estimator is quite arbitrary. Isn't the original idea behind QTRAN that the true action-value estimator would accurately track the true action-values?**\n\nAs we explained in Section 3, the performance of QTRAN++ (and QTRAN) is governed by two factors: (a) quality of true action-value estimator tracking the true action-values and (b) quality of transformed action-value estimator tracking the true action-value estimator. While the original QTRAN focused on designing the true action-value estimator to improve (a), we additionally use the semi-monotonic network to improve (b). To be specific, the semi-monotonic networks improve (b) by implicitly biasing the true action-value estimator to learn a monotonic function that can be easily approximated by the monotonic transformed action-value estimator. In our revised paper, we have further clarified this point in Section 3.2.\n\nWe also point out how the semi-monotonic network is necessary for achieving the best performance in our experiments. Indeed, in Figure 4 of our revised paper, one can observe a solid gap between QTRAN++ and FC-QTRAN++ (QTRAN++ without the semi-monotonic network) for three scenarios, i.e., 10m_vs_11m, MMM2 (negative), 3s_vs_5z, and performs at least as good as FC-QTRAN++ for other seven scenarios.\n\n---\n\n**2. Gradients are now also backpropagated from the \"tracking loss\" into the \"true\" action-value estimator, which makes it somewhat unclear what it is actually representing.**\n\nAs explained in Section 3, the performance of QTRAN++ depends on the quality of the transformed action-value estimator for tracking the true action-value estimator, i.e., the \u201ctracking loss.\u201d Through the backpropagation, our true action-value estimator can help in minimizing the tracking loss in addition to its original role, i.e., estimating the true action-value.\n\nFurthermore, the effectiveness of the backpropagation is supported by our empirical observation. Indeed, in Figure 4 of our revised paper, one can observe a significant gap between QTRAN++ and QTRAN++ without the backpropagation, i.e., Fix-QTRAN++ for all of the ten scenarios.\n\n---\n\n**3.

Specifically, it improves on the QTRAN algorithm, a theoretically justified algorithm which previously had not produced strong learning performance. With these improvements, QTRAN++ outperforms baselines on the SMAC environments.\n\nI recommend accepting this paper. It delivers strong performance on a popular benchmark for complex, cooperative multiagent learning (SMAC). While the algorithmic contribution is incremental, it still delivers insight into how to improve the empirical performance of a theoretically interesting and well-justified algorithm.\n\n ## Positives\n\nThe problem addressed - cooperative multiagent environments with CTDE - is a widely studied and important one. It is well set up in the paper, including discussion of related algorithms.\n\nThe base algorithm - QTRAN - should theoretically perform well in a wider variety of environments than other algorithms for these problems, so improving its performance is particularly valuable. The improvements made to the algorithm are clear and well motivated; section 3.1 in particular explains clearly the difference the modified loss is intended to make.\n\nThe empirical studies in the paper are strong. They show that QTRAN++ outperforms several baselines in data efficiency and final performance across a variety of domains. Further, a comprehensive ablation study shows that each of the improvements made to QTRAN is independently important (in at least some domains).\n\n## Negatives\n\nThe algorithmic contribution of the paper is relatively minor, since it provides fairly simple modifications to an existing algorithm.\n\nExperimentally, it would be good to see experiments on similar domains to those addressed in the original QTRAN paper, which are designed to probe the advantages QTRAN has over related algorithms. This would demonstrate that QTRAN++ retains the benefits of QTRAN in non-monotonic factorisable environments.\n\n## Sources of reviewer uncertainty\n\nI am not knowledgeable enough in this domain to be certain of the coverage of the baselines and domains in the paper. Since the empirical performance of the algorithm is central to the paper, this is important."

Defining each skill with a manually-designed reward function limits this repertoire and imposes a manual engineering burden. Self-supervised agents that set their own goals can automate this process, but designing appropriate goal setting objectives can be difficult, and often involves heuristic design decisions. In this paper, we propose a formal exploration objective for goal-reaching policies that maximizes state coverage. We show that this objective is equivalent to maximizing the entropy of the goal distribution together with goal reaching performance, where goals correspond to full state observations. To instantiate this principle, we present an algorithm called Skew-Fit for learning a maximum-entropy goal distributions. Skew-Fit enables self-supervised agents to autonomously choose and practice reaching diverse goals. We show that, under certain regularity conditions, our method converges to a uniform distribution over the set of valid states, even when we do not know this set beforehand. Our experiments show that it can learn a variety of manipulation tasks from images, including opening a door with a real robot, entirely from scratch and without any manually-designed reward function."

                "content": "(continued from previous comment)\n\n> What do you exactly mean by a policy to be reusable?\nBy reusable, we mean that a policy can reach user-defined goals after performing exploration. In other words, it is a goal-conditioned policy rather than a policy that only performs exploration. For example, imagine you left a robot in a large office. If it performs exploration well, then the robot will autonomously visit every room in the building, regardless of whether it is goal-oriented or not. The difference between a goal-conditioned and non-goal-conditioned exploration policy is based on what happens next: After exploration, you can tell a goal-conditioned policy, \u201cPlease go to room A.\u201d and it will know how to go to room A since it has already practiced reaching every possible goal. In other words, we can *reuse* the exploration policy to achieve these user-specified goals. However, if the exploration policy is not goal-conditioned but instead trained with an exploration-reward bonuses, then there is no way to control the policy. It may have visited every room during exploration, but at any given time, it only knows how to reach one location. In particular, it will always go to the last state that was deemed novel by the exploration-reward bonus.\n\n\n> What do you exactly mean by a distribution over terminal states? Why not the normalized discounted weighting of states?\nBy terminal state, we mean the last state of each episode. So, the distribution over terminal states is the distribution of states where the policy will be located at the end of each episode. For example, will the policy always end at position X? Or will its final position have a Gaussian distribution? Uniform distribution?\n\nFor our analysis, we found it more natural to study the distribution over terminal states, since in the goal-conditioned setting, we would like our goal-conditioned policy to *end* at a goal state when the episode is complete. However, we believe that our analysis could be applied to normalized discounted weighting of states by allowing an agent to constantly set new goals rather than waiting until the beginning of a new episode to set the next goal.\n\n\n> Does \u201cno user-specified rewards\u201d mean a sparse reward?\nNo, and we understand that this may have been a source of confusion. By \u201cno user-specified rewards\u201d we mean that the user does not need to manually engineer a reward for each task. Instead, as described in Section 4, we use the same reward as the one used in RIG, which is an approximation of the log probability of the goal given the current state. Overall, this means that the same code and generic reward is used for the real-world door task and all of the simulated tasks. For example, there is no reward that specifically tells the robot to open the door, nor is there a reward that specifically tells the robot to pick up or move the objects. Instead, the same Skew-Fit objective encourages the robot to learn to manipulate these objects into as many configurations as possible (by setting diverse goals and then reaching those goals) regardless of the environment."

                "content": "Thank you for the additional response. We answer your remaining questions, and are happy to continue discussing if there are still points of confusion. In particular, we explain the large empirical and conceptual differences between Skew-Fit and prior methods, both of which we believe would be of interest to the ICLR community.\n\n\n> How does Skew-Fit relate to hindsight experience replay (HER) and similar approaches? How is Skew-Fit different?\nWe note that there are significant empirical differences between Skew-Fit and HER. In Figure 5, we see that HER does not perform well without access to an oracle uniform goal distribution (more on this below). Specifically, HER has a final distance that is 400%, 200%, and 150% higher than the final distance when using of Skew-Fit, on the door, pickup, and pushing tasks, respectively. Similarly, Skew-Fit outperforms other prior methods across all tasks.\n\nA major conceptual difference between Skew-Fit and many prior methods, such as HER, is that we *learn* the goal distribution, whereas many prior methods *assume* that a uniform goal distribution is provided. When using images as observations, this amounts to assuming that the agent knows the distribution of natural images -- an unreasonable assumption in most cases. For example, in the object-pushing task of the hindsight experience replay (HER) paper, an XY goal-position for the object is sampled uniformly from within the workspace of the robot and given to the robot for exploration. While this procedure is simple to implement in a simulated domain and when the goal corresponds to an XY-Cartesian position in the plane, it is much more challenging when goals correspond to images, as in the environments that we tested. Randomly sampling an image will result in an image of static noise. So, Skew-Fit learns a goal distribution that corresponds to the uniform distribution over the set of valid states, instead of assuming that we are given access to this goal distribution.\n\nBecause most prior goal-conditioned RL methods assume access to an oracle uniform goal distribution, most of the methods have only been applied to simulated domains, where defining such a goal distribution by hand is easy. As our experiments show, without access to a uniform distribution, prior methods such as HER perform poorly. Moreover, many of these methods (AutoGoal GAN, Rank-Based Prioritization, HER) assume access to ground-truth state information for computing the reward, which is readily available only in simulation. Enabling goal-conditioned RL to be applied to domains where the goal-space and reward function are unknown a priori, such as image-based domains, is important if we want to use these methods outside of simulation and for real-world applications. We believe that Skew-Fit is a useful step, both empirically and conceptually, towards this objective. Note that we evaluate Skew-Fit on a real-world image-based robotic manipulation task to demonstrate this (see Figure 1 and 7).\n\nAs far as we know, the only other goal-conditioned methods that have been developed for goal images are RIG and DISCERN, but neither of these methods address the important question of how goals should be sampled for exploration. Applying Skew-Fit results in considerable performance gains over these prior methods: Figure 5 shows that RIG and DISCERN have final distances that are about 100% higher than that of Skew-Fit. Lastly, the only method that has been applied to real-world robot domains from images is RIG, and we found that Skew-Fit outperformed it not only in simulation, but also on the real-world door task.\n\n\n> How are these goals determined in the first place?\nWe first describe how we generate goals chosen for evaluation. For the simulated tasks, we use an \u201coracle\u201d sampling procedure that exploits the fact that the task is simulated. Note that this procedure is only used for evaluation and never used by the algorithms. To generate an evaluation goal, we sample a ground-truth state uniformly distribution from the entire state space, set the environment to this state, capture an image corresponding to this state, and use the resulting image as the goal. We then return the environment state back to its original state and instruct the policy to reach the captured goal image. This procedure based on ground-truth state information is only used for evaluation and in simulation. For the real-world door task, we took images of the door at 5 different angles, evenly spaced from 0 to 45 degrees. Like before, these goals are only used for evaluation and not be the algorithms.\n\nWe now describe how goals for exploration are generated. At the very beginning of exploration, the agent takes random actions in the environment to collect a set of states. From thereon, the exploration goals are generated by the agent by sampling from the learned goal distribution, which is learned with Skew-Fit.\n\n(continued in next comment)"

Given this, why should we even consider this type of p(s) and why not the normalized discounted weighting of states - and maximize this distribution accordingly? I do agree that simply maximizing this might not be sufficient, which is why you include the H(s|g) term - but that raises further concerns in my opinion, as follows : \n\nWith the current formulation, we would now require distributing goals across the state space - this is similar to Hindsight Experience Replay and related approaches? How are these goals determined in the first place - is it more like a random sampling of states that you consider as goals - and then encouraging the agent to reach these goals?\n\nIsn't this method then a very slight modification of HER and other related papers? To me, it seems like that makes the contribution very marginal - since instead of HER, now we have a clever way of maximizing a MI term, but it is indeed doing something very similar to HER from a technical contribution? \n\nFurther comment : I don't necessarily agree, or fully understand this from a technical perspective - \"We instead would like for this policy to be reusable, by, e.g., being able to control what state it reaches\". \n\nWhat do you exactly mean by a policy to be reusable? Is it more like a transfer learning setting? If so, are there any experiments that justify that using the trained policy in a new task is useful? \n\nOverall, as you mention \"first uniformly set goals over the state space (maximize H(g)) and then separately learn to reach those goals (minimize H(g | s))\" - this seems to me like a very minor modification to several other tons of papers related to HER - where we randomly sample goal states and encourage the agent to reach these goal states. This paper seems like a very marginal contribution compared to that."

                "content": "Thank you for the suggestion and detailed review. As suggested, we have modified the introduction to expand our discussion around H(s). We also answer the questions about the use of H(s) and H(s|g) below, and describe how the experimental results do in fact show that Skew-Fit substantially outperforms prior methods. We believe that these clarifications address the major criticisms raised in your review, but we would be happy to address any other points or discuss this further.\n\nQ: Why should H(s) used as an exploration objective?\n\nThe goal of our method is to learn a policy that can reach any possible goal state, in the absence of a single user-specified task reward. Prior work has already argued that the entropy of the state distribution H(s) is a suitable exploration objective [1]. In our case, p(s) represents the distribution over terminal states in a finite horizon task, though we believe extensions to infinite horizon stationary distributions should also be possible. Unfortunately, maximizing H(s) by itself does not necessarily provide for a useful policy in the absence of a user-specified reward. For example, if we maximize state coverage by using reward bonuses based on state novelty [2,3,4,5], then, in the absence of user-specified rewards, the resulting policy will only reach the latest states deemed novel.  We instead would like for this policy to be reusable, by, e.g., being able to control what state it reaches. This observation motivates the inclusion of the second term -- H(s|g) -- which amounts to training the policy to effectively (with high probability) reach the commanded goal, while being able to visit as many states/goals as possible. Our overall objective is therefore to maximize H(s) - H(s | g), since maximizing only H(s) does not result in a useful policy. As you pointed out, this has the added benefit that the corresponding algorithm is tractable by using Equation 1, whereas directly maximizing H(s) is difficult. We have accordingly modified the introduction to (1) discuss prior work, (2) raise the concern with directly maximizing H(s), and (3) include a more specific definition of H(s).\n\nQ: What\u2019s the intuition behind the new objective MI(S;G)?\n\nThe mutual information provides an equivalent interpretation of our new objective: the new objective changes the exploration objective from \u201cuniformly visit all the states,\u201d as prior work has advocated, to a two stage process: first uniformly set goals over the state space (maximize H(g)) and then separately learn to reach those goals (minimize H(g | s)). At the optimum, the exploration policy will uniformly visits all states, and has the added benefit that we obtain a goal-conditioned policy that can be reused to reach goals.\n\n\nExperiments\nWe understand that there were concerns over the significance of the results. We find this concern surprising, as there is a clear difference between Skew-Fit and the next best prior work in Figure 5. Specifically, for the pickup task, Skew-Fit is the only method that makes significant progress: no prior method consistently picks up the object (Figure 6), and Skew-Fit\u2019s final distance is approximately half that of the next best method. For the pushing tasks, the next best method results in a final distance that is 1.5 times worse than that of Skew-Fit, with an average score that is 3-4 standard deviations away from the average score of Skew-Fit. On the door task, some prior methods perform only slightly worse than Skew-Fit. However, we note that this task is much easier than the other tasks (the x-axis more than 4x shorter than the other tasks), as prior work [6] using these environments has also observed. Lastly, the difference on the real-robot experiments are particularly pronounced, with a final success rate double that of the prior method. While we acknowledge that the presentation of the results in the plots could be improved, the results themselves show that Skew-Fit is substantially better than all prior methods that we compared with.\n\nWe agree that it is informative to include a simplified experiment that does not directly jump to using goal-conditioned policies nor images. Therefore, Figure 3 of Section 6 analyzes a simplified 2D navigation task. While we did not have room to include in the main paper, Figure 9 of the appendix provides an \u201cin between\u201d experiment that does not contain images, but does include goal-conditioned policies."

The corresponding conditional entropy of the goal given the state, H(G | S) would be zero, since given the current state, there would be no uncertainty over the goal (the goal must have been the current state since the policy is optimal). So, the objective of goal-conditioned RL can be interpreted as finding a policy such that H(G | S) = 0.

They show that a formal objective for maximizing state coverage is equivalent to maximizing the entropy of a goal distribution. The core idea is to propose a method to maximize entropy of a goal distribution, or a state distribution since goals are full states. They show that the proposed method to maximize the state or goal distribution can lead to diverse exploration behaviour sufficient for solving complex image based manipulation tasks. \n\n\nComments and Questions : \n\n\t- The core idea is to maximize the entropy of the state visitation frequency H(s). It is not clear from the paper whether the authors talk about the normalized discounted weighting of states (a distribution) or the stationary distribution? The entropy of the state visitation distribution only deals with valid states - but I am not sure what it means to maximize the entropy of this term exactly in terms of exploration, since it is neither the discounted weighting of states or the stationary distribution for an infinite horizon task? \n\t- The authors do mention that maximizing the entropy of H(s) is not sufficient - so instead suggests for maxmizing entropy of H(s|g). But why is this even sufficient for exploration - if I do not consider new tasks at test time but only the training task? How is this a sufficient exploration objective? Furthermore, since it is the conditional entropy given goal states, the fundamental idea of this is not clear from the paper. \n\t- Overall, I am not convinced that an objective based on H(s|g) is equivalent to an maximizing H(s), and why is this even a good objective for exploration? The meaning of H(s) to me is a bit vague from the text (due to reasons above) and therefore H(s|g) does not convince to be a good exploration objective either?\n\t- The paper then talks about the MI(S;G) to be maximized for exploration - what does this MI formally mean? I understand the breakdown from equation 1, but why is this a sufficient exploration objective? There are multiple ideas introduced at the same time - the MI(s;g) and talking about test time and training time exploration - but the idea itself is not convincing for a sufficient exploration objective. In light of this, I am not sure whether the core idea of the paper is convincing enough to me. \n\t- I think the paper needs more theoretical insights and details to show why this form of objective based on the MI(s;g) is good enough for exploration. Theoretically, there are a lot of details missing from the paper, and the paper simply proposes the idea of MI(s;g) and talks about formal or computationally tractable ways of computing this term. While the proposed solutuon to compute MI(s;g) seems reasonable, I don't think there is enough contribution or details as to why is maximizing H(s) good for exploration in the first place.\n\t- Experimentally, few tasks are proposed comparing skew-fit with other baselines like HER and AutoGoal GAN - but the differences in all the results seem negligible (example : Figure 5). \n\t- I am not sure why the discussion of goal conditioned policies is introduced rightaway. To me, a more convincing approach would have been to first discuss why H(s) and the entropy of this is good for exploration (discounted weighting or stationary state distribution and considering episodic and  infinite horizon tasks). If H(s) is indeed a difficult or not sufficient term to maximize the entropy for, then it might make sense to introduce goal conditioned policies? Following then, it might be convincing to discuss why goal conditioned policies are indeed required, and then tractable ways of computing MI(s;g). \n\t- Experimentally, I think the paper needs significantly more work - especially considering hard exploration tasks (it might be simple setups too like mazes to begin with), and then to propose a set of new experimental results, without jumping directly to image based tasks as discussed here and then comparing to all the goal conditioned policy baselines. \n\nOverall, I would recommend to reject this paper, as I am not convinced by the proposed solution, and there are lot of theoretical details missing from the paper. It skips a lot of theoretical insights required to propose a new exploration based objective, and the paper proposes a very specific solution for a set a very specific set of experimental setups. \n\n\n\n"

The key idea is to learn a generative model of goal distribution to match the weighted empirical distribution, where the rare states receive larger weights. This encourages the model to generate more diverse and novel goals for goal-conditioned RL policies to reach.\n\nPros:\nThe Skew-Fit exploration technique is independent of the goal-conditioned reinforcement learning algorithm and can be plugged in with any goal-conditioned methods. The experiments offer a comparison to several prior exploration techniques and demonstrate a clear advantage of the proposed Skew-Fit method. It is evaluated in a variety of continuous control tasks in simulation and a door opening task on a real robot. A formal analysis of the algorithm is provided under certain assumptions.\n\nCons:\nThe weakest part of this work is the task setup. The method has only been evaluated on simplistic short-horizon control tasks. It\u2019d be interesting to see how this method is applied to longer-horizon multi-stage control tasks, where exploration is a more severe challenge. It is especially when the agent has no access to task reward and only explores the environment to maximize state coverage.

However, the covert attack is the emerging threat to the pre-train-then-fine tuning learning paradigm. The backdoor attack is a typical challenge, which the victim model fails on the trigger-activated samples while behaves normally on others. These backdoors could survive the cascading fine-tuning stage, which continually posing the application of pre-trained models. In this paper, we proposed a Gradient Broadcast Adaptation (GBA) method, prevent the model from controlled producing outputs in a trigger-anchor-free manner. We design the prompt-based tuning, flexibly accessing the rare tokens while providing a fair measure of distance in word embedding space. The gradient broadcast alleviates lazy updating of potential triggers and purges the underlying abnormal weights. The GBA defense method is evaluated over five text-classification tasks against three state-of-the-art backdoor attacks.

Please find our response below.\n\n----\n\n$\\textbf{Q1: [Non-parameterized way]}$ There may be other non-parameterized ways, such as information-entropy smoothed or neighbor cluster, in the repair of backdoored tokens.\n\n$\\textbf{A1:}$ Yes, we regard the information-entropy method or the neighbor cluster method as \"static\" methods, which may be helpful in the end-to-end paradigm. Especially when a trained model is prepared for deployment. Such a method can detect the backdoor tokens and then eliminate them to prevent further damage to the whole system. However, the \"static\" method may not be a good default for transfer learning, where the generalization ability matters most. Any static modification to the pre-trained model could reduce the generalization ability for certain downstream tasks. Also, we assume the pre-training objective is not a good helper for targeting the backdoor trigger for the training objective gap between fine-tuning and pre-training. \n\n----\n\n$\\textbf{Q2: [Backdoor-erasing methods in other domain]}$ Are all the current backdoor-erasing methods or backdoor-outline methods (mainly proposed in CV) not useful in the case of pre-trained language models?\n\n$\\textbf{A2:}$ We have surveyed recent popular backdoor-outline methods or backdoor-erasing methods in Section 2. Their limitations are obvious, mainly designed for end-to-end models, never taking the $\\textbf{inheritance of backdoor}$ into consideration. Also, the mainstream defense methods are designed for continuity input, not for the discrete input in text domain.\n\n----\n\n$\\textbf{Q3: [Variant of distilling?]}$ Can we view the GBA method as a variant of neural distillation or pruning?\n\n$\\textbf{A3:}$ For neural distillation, the core idea is to learn knowledge from a teacher model. The only teacher model in GBA is the model itself. GBA distills the \"normal\" gradient from the class tokens to the rare tokens which may be trigger candidates. To some extent, we may view GBA as a variant of self distillation. For pruning, the core idea is to cut the redundant or harmful part of the model. Instead of disabling the trigger tokens, GBA tends to repair the backdoored tokens while preserving the generalization ability of the original pre-trained model.\n\n----\n\n$\\textbf{Q4: [Performance gap]}$  Figure 2 shows a clean acc drop when increasing the data size of clean data from 0\\% to 1\\%. Does GBA hurt the model performance under few-shot settings more than the former distill-based method?\n\n$\\textbf{A4:}$ We assume the clean acc drop may reveal the influence of generalization ability. In Figure 2, we also observe the performance drop of the former distill-based method NAD. Compared with the negligible performance drop of our proposed GBA, NAD leads to more reduction of generalization ability under all data settings.\n\n----\n"

For example, in Table 2, the proposed method cannot surpass SOTA under several settings. Plus the current version only conducts experiments on bert-base-uncased. It would be helpful to validate the proposed method using at least one more pre-trained language model like RoBERTa.\n\n$\\textbf{A1:}$ Thanks for the constructive suggestion. We use the RoBERTa as the benchmark and explore more experiments in Appendix D.1. We find RoBERTa is more robust to backdoor attacks but still suffers from strong baselines like BadNets. And more importantly, the results also reveal our proposed GBA defense still works well on RoBERTa, reducing the ASR score to nearly zero.\n\n----\n\n$\\textbf{Q2: [The moderated improvement]}$ Actually I like simple but effective methods. But given that the empirical results are only marginally significant, I am worried that the proposed method might be too simple.\n\n$\\textbf{A2:}$ Firstly, we would apologize that we have misplaced the results in the previous submission. In the re-submitted paper, we have replaced the original NAD results with the NAD and NAD-C. The first is acquired based on NAD's original assumption, and the second is designed to fully show the NAD's potential performance on settings that are impossible to achieve in reality. Besides, the empirical results show that our proposed methods outperformed the original NAD method.\n\n----\n\n$\\textbf{Q3: [The correction for Eq.(4)]}$ Should the probability ratio in Eq 4 be inside the $\\sum$ ? Or shall we use $w'$ inside the $\\sum$?\n\n$\\textbf{A3:}$ Thanks for sharing your thoughts on this minor mistake. We should use $w'$ inside the $\\sum$. In Eq 4, $Q_{Ew}$ is computed for each token $w$ in the vocab with the average gradient of input example, which noted as $\\sum_{w' \\in x_{input}} \\frac{\\nabla_{Ew'}}{N}$.\n\n----\n\n$\\textbf{Q4: [Updating in the minibatch]}$  For each minibatch, does the proposed method update all the embeddings of words in vocab or just update words present in the current batch?\n\n$\\textbf{A4:}$ Yes, the proposed method will update all the embeddings of words in vocab. The frequency of rare tokens in the batch is nearly zero, we will never update them enough if we just update words present in the current batch. This misunderstanding may come from the wrong presentation of Eq 4, and we have corrected it in this version.\n\n----\n\n$\\textbf{Q5: [The few-shot property]}$ The proposed method can help defend against backdoor attacks with only 1\\% of clean training data, while the SOTA method NAD needs more. I am wondering whether this is only because of the few-shot property of prompt, or it is credited to the proposed gradient broadcast.\n\n$\\textbf{A5:}$ We include more ablation studies in Appendix D.2. Without the proposed gradient broadcast, the prompt tuning reaches good performance on clean data, which could be credited to the few-shot property of the prompt. However, it loses the defense capability of backdoor attacks. Please refer to that discussion.\n\n----\n\n$\\textbf{Q6: [Soft template optimization]}$  What is the proposed soft template optimization for prompt?\n\n$\\textbf{A6:}$ In traditional hard-coded template optimization, the template of the downstream task is hand-crafted, like \"<S1> It was [MASK] .\" for sentiment classification. <S1> is the input sentence and [MASK] is the target word like \"positive\" or \"negative\". This paradigm needs extensive computation to find the best hand-crafted template. Instead, we use a soft template to replace the hard-coded input sentence with several learnable tokens \"[a]*\". The Adam optimizer is hard to find the proper discrete tokens \"[a]*\". So we fill the template in the embedding-level instead of token-level (discussed in Section 3.3). We concatenate the embeddings of tokens \u201c[a]*\" with the input sentence and optimize the embeddings of the template token to find the best-match soft template that can maximize the downstream task's performance.  \n\n----\n\n\n\n"

Please find our response below.\n\n----\n$\\textbf{Q1:[ Assumption on more complicated tasks] }$ The approach seems to be based on the idea that the semantics of the tokens in the same sentence are similar. But this might not be true for more complicated tasks. Unfortunately, the experiments only consider tasks with only few classes, mostly two classes, and just one dataset with 4 classes. In this case, the task becomes learning if a word is related to the target class. More complicated tasks would show how this defense would perform in the real world.\n \n$\\textbf{A1:}$ We were deeply sorry for causing inappropriate understanding from the minor issue in Eq.(4). We have reformulated this equation in the re-submission. We design the gradient broadcast under the assumption that the gradient could be used to measure the semantic distance between rare tokens and the inputs, which motivates us to update the target embeddings of the rare tokens following the common tokens' gradients.\n\nIn this way, we assign an extra pulling force $Q_{Ew}$ to update rare tokens in vocab based on the semantic distance. We believe the proposed gradient broadcast method could be extended to more complicated tasks. As a concrete example, we include more results on the GLUE benchmark in Appendix D.2, and our method performs well on both NLI and regression tasks.\n\n----\n\n$\\textbf{Q2: [Questions on BadNets]}$  The description of the attacks used is not sufficient. While the core algorithms can be learned from the cited papers, the experiment setting doesn't explain how the triggers are chosen, what the portion of backdoored samples in the test dataset, or how they are constructed. Thus, it cannot be inferred if the evaluation was done fairly and properly. For example, BadNets (Gu et al., 2017) doesn't discuss poisoning of text models at all, and this necessary information cannot be found.\n\n$\\textbf{A2:}$ Yes, the BadNets are originally proposed and applied in the CV domain. We mimic the original implementation and find a way to apply it in the NLP domain. In this re-submission, we included more detailed descriptions of attacking and defense implementation in Appendix B.\n\n---- \n\n$\\textbf{Q3: [The paper writing]}$ The paper needs major improvement in writing. There are many errors (e.g., we usually takes, state-of-the-art, We are the first ... method, safely adaptation method, a method which do not ...), unnecessarily repeated sentences or words (e.g., all whole vocab, Sec 3.1), and missing explanations/definitions (e.g., V, $\\theta^*$). Missing information can be understood by a domain expert, but the paper should be self-contained as much as possible if not citing a prior work. Also, many statements are over-generalized.\n\n$\\textbf{A3:}$ Thanks for the constructive suggestion. We have revised the draft and rebuilt the paper in this submission. We will try to list all the improvements and revisions in the final review abstract if it is available.\n\n----\n\n$\\textbf{Q4: [How the gradient updating work]}$ If the trigger does not appear in the training data, the embedding still wouldn't be updated as Q is computed and applied per sentence according to Eq 4. So, it is unclear how this update is significantly different from just updating the token with its own gradient only. Comparing the gradient and Q can be interesting. It almost looks like the effect is using a larger learning rate, but there was not sufficient analysis on this.\n\n$\\textbf{A4:}$ Yes, this problem is related to the minor issue in Eq.(4). In the corrected formulation (of the re-submission version), we compute Q for each token in the vocab (including common tokens and rare tokens). Even if the rare tokens never appear in the input batch, the rare tokens' embeddings will also be updated with the pulling force Q. In Section 5.2 (of the re-submission version), we provide a more detailed analysis between Q and the standard gradient update and testify its effectiveness in erasing the triggers.\n\n----\n\n\n\n"

                "content": "This paper identifies an emerging threat for the prevailing pre-trained models -- the inheritance of backdoor attack, and proposes a simple yet effective defense approach: gradient broadcast adaptation (GBA). Instead of the traditional \u201cerasing triggers\u201d, GBA utilizes the \u201cprompt-tuning\u201d as a tool to guide the \u201cperturbed weights\u201d back to the normal state, which helps avoid the degradation of generalization ability. It provides an exciting and novel analysis of why backdoor attacks could be inherited during the pretraining and tuning procedure. Meanwhile, the authors perform an empirical evaluation of the proposed method against four state-of-the-art backdoor attacks. In the security of pre-trained models, the inheritance of backdoor (adapt backdoored models to various downstream tasks) is an important challenge. Injected with the backdoor, the existing model could be further developed for a long life-circle with backdoor survival. This paper examines this interesting and under-explored topic. It locates the most vulnerable component of pre-trained language models \u2013 word embeddings, which is the reason for the ever-lasting backdoor. It shows that by carefully optimizing the word embeddings, and the malicious backdoor could be erased or repaired, taking no effect on further adaptation.\n\nBy taking inspiration from the \u201cerasing backdoor\u201d viewpoint of \u201cNeural Distillation\u201d prior work, it paves a new way of defense instead of \u201cabandon redundant weights\u201d, which obeys the generalization purpose of pre-training. The tool of \u201cprompt-tuning\u201d is also more natural to pre-trained models.\n\nThe paper proposes a much more intuitive optimization strategy that guides \u201cthose perturbed weights\u201d back to the normal state by joining the adaptation stage, thus erasing backdoors while preserving the generalization ability of pre-trained models. Additionally, as a plugin of the optimizer, the usage scenarios of the proposed approach are unlimited.\n\nExperiments show that just by focusing on the word embeddings, one can disable nearly all backdoor attacks. I suggest the author consider this as a \u201cfirewall\u201d to the standard adaptation operations.\n\nComments:\n\n1. The paper is well organized, and the motivation is clearly written.\n2. The authors try to unleash a wave of security concerns in pre-trained models. Many existing works focus on improving the performance of pre-training and adaptation while neglecting the threats of backdoor attacks/adversarial attacks. Following this paper's problem setting and experiment results, it may be easy to plug GBA into the current pipeline. One of the benefits is that we do not need to worry about performance degradation or computation efficiency.\n3. After reading this paper, I can hardly think about a better alternative for the proposed GBA approach. To the best of my knowledge, the root of backdoor attack inheritance only could be the lazy update of rare tokens. This is consistent with the authors\u2019 claim. However, there may be other non-parameterized ways, such as information-entropy smoothed or neighbor cluster, in the repair of backdoored tokens. I am wondering if it can work, but it deserves a trial. I also have some additional questions to discuss with the authors:\nAre all the current backdoor-erasing methods or backdoor-outline methods (mainly proposed in CV) not useful in the case of pre-trained language models?\nCan we view the GBA method as a variant of neural distillation or pruning? So if I were to turn this into a method that outlines the triggers first and then erases them in a blacklist.\nFigure 2 shows a clean acc drop when increasing the data size of clean data from 0% to 1%. Does GBA hurt the model performance under few-shot settings more than the former distill-based method?\n This paper targets an under-explored fundamental challenge in pre-training and adaptation trends. This is a brave and valuable step in the security research of pre-trained models. I enjoy reading this paper, and this is the first time I have seen a reasonable solution to the inheritance of the backdoor phenomenon. Although some problems need to be corrected, I believe authors should be able to take them in hand."

Recent advances in deep learning, especially the discovery of various attention mechanisms and newer architectures in addition to widely used RNN and CNN in natural language processing, have allowed for better use of the temporal ordering of items that each user has engaged with. In particular, the SASRec model, inspired by the popular Transformer model in natural languages processing, has achieved state-of-the-art results. However, SASRec, just like the original Transformer model, is inherently an un-personalized model and does not include personalized user embeddings. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Personalized Transformer (SSE-PT) model, outperforming SASRec by almost 5% in terms of NDCG@10 on 5 real-world datasets. Furthermore, after examining some random users' engagement history, we find our model not only more interpretable but also able to focus on recent engagement patterns for each user. Moreover, our SSE-PT model with a slight modification, which we call SSE-PT++, can handle extremely long sequences and outperform SASRec in ranking results with comparable training speed, striking a balance between performance and speed requirements. Our novel application of the Stochastic Shared Embeddings (SSE) regularization is essential to the success of personalization. Code and data are open-sourced at https://github.com/SSE-PT/SSE-PT."

                "content": "Hi Reviewer, thank you very much for raising your confusion to us on experiments. We will do a better job in clarifying on how we compared with HGN in experimental section. \n\nTo explain why HGN is not doing as well as SASRec in our reported results: First, it is worth noting that the HGN paper not only used completely different datasets, but also used very distinct evaluation procedures from SASRec. Instead of predicting next engaged item, it has 10% interactions in test set, such that one prediction is correct as long as it falls into the test set, while we (and SASRec) are doing another task of predicting precisely next item, in which there is only 1 correct answer. So the task they consider is an easier task than us. Moreover, If you read the HGN paper carefully, they are mainly focused on accommodating very short sequences. In paper's experiments, they use hyper-parameter $L = 5$, where $L$ is the length of sequence used for training and inference. On contrast, our method SSE-PT and SASRec uses $L = 200$ for Movielens1m and $L=50$ for other datasets. We think that mainly accounts for the difference in original paper's reported performances and our reported performances. It is very possible that for very short sequences, HGN works quite well, better than SASRec as they have shown in their paper. We will add this delicate detail to the final version of the paper to avoid any confusions for future readers. Moreover, we modified original HGN codes to make HGN's evaluation the same as that of SASRec and open sourced at: https://github.com/SSE-PT/SSE-PT/tree/master/HGN_baseline. You have a look at our codes for both our SSE-PT and HGN baseline.\n\nAs to your other comments. \n1. Yes, it is correct that first few rows (A to F and H, I) of results in Table 1 are from SASRec paper, the reason is that we use the exactly same experimental settings on exactly same datasets. So we decided to trust the results reported in SASRec paper for older methods. We include those earlier baselines for completeness but those are not as important as SASRec because SASRec has been shown to outperform those methods. We did re-run SASRec and got slightly better results in Table 1 than the ones originally reported in SASRec paper.\n\n2. Yes, Table 3 we use different metrics than Table 1, because we realize the NDCG@10, Recall@10 does not accurately reflect how bad over-fitting is as NDCG@5 and Recall@5. The percentages of improvement for using a well-suited regularization are much more dramatic once you switch the metrics to top 5 from top 10. This means good regularization are extremely important for top k ranking results, especially when $k$ is small. The results in Table 3 would still hold for top 10 but less dramatic for percentages of gains. On the other hand, because we want to make a fair comparison with SASRec on the same datasets, we chose to use same top-10 metrics in Table 1. This is our reasoning as to why metrics used in Table 1 and 3 are different.  \n\n3. As to the ablation study, the ablation study of personalization is done in Table 10 in Appendix and we have had a dedicated section 4.3 for different ablation studies done for each component of the model.\n\nWhile our paper does build on previous work, we think that the paper is an important contribution for 2 reasons:\n1. In the SASRec paper, they come to the conclusion that they \"empirically find that adding an explicit user embedding doesn\u2019t improve performance (presumably because the model already considers all of the user\u2019s actions).\"  Contrary to this, we find that personalization is actually possible for transformer-based models and \nis proving to be very useful for recommendation systems in terms of both performance and interpretation.\n\n2.

Class-conditional probability densities based on Bayesian nonparametric mixtures of factor analyzers (BNP-MFA) over the input space are used to design soft decision labels for feature to label isometry. Classconditional distributions over features are also learned using BNP-MFA to develop plug-in maximum a posterior (MAP) classifiers to replace the traditional multinomial logistic softmax classification layers. This novel unsupervised augmented framework, which we call geometrically robust networks (GRN), is applied to CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and to Radio-ML (a time series dataset for radio modulation recognition). We demonstrate the robustness of GRN models to adversarial attacks from fast gradient sign method, Carlini-Wagner, and projected gradient descent."

For example, ducks in an image may be recognized based on their typical background scenery, such as lakes or streams. This phenomenon, also known as shortcut learning, is emerging as a key limitation of the current generation of machine learning models. In this work, we introduce a set of experiments to deepen our understanding of shortcut learning and its implications. We design a training setup with several shortcut cues, named WCST-ML, where each cue is equally conducive to the visual recognition problem at hand. Even under equal opportunities, we observe that (1) certain cues are preferred to others, (2) solutions biased to the easy\u2013to\u2013learn cues tend to converge to relatively flat minima on the loss surface, and (3) the solutions focusing on those preferred cues are far more abundant in the parameter space. We explain the abundance of certain cues via their Kolmogorov (descriptional) complexity: solutions corresponding to Kolmogorov-simple cues are abundant in the parameter space and are thus preferred by DNNs. Our studies are based on the synthetic dataset DSprites and the face dataset UTKFace. In our WCST-ML, we observe that the inborn bias of models leans toward simple cues, such as color and ethnicity. Our findings emphasize the importance of active human intervention to remove the inborn model biases that may cause negative societal impacts."

Specifically, they focus on settings where multiple cues are equally likely, though not all of them are equally exploited. To set up such a scenario, they introduce the WCST-ML task, in which the prevalence of cues can be parametrically controlled. They also conduct empirical studies on the more naturalistic UTKFace dataset. The authors introduce a set of metrics, such as path connectivity, attractor basin properties, etc. to analyze cue preferences from a loss landscape perspective. The authors also explain these observations based on the \"complexity\" of cues.    Strengths:\n\nOverall this is a well-written paper, clearly motivated and carefully constructed. The finding that the number of solutions (i.e. parameter configurations) that rely on preferred cues are also abundant is a good corroboratory result.\n\nThe motivations for this study are also exactly what the field needs at this point, given the abundant use of deep convolutional networks for a variety of applications with minimal understanding of its exact decision-making mechanisms.\n\nThough the synthetic task (Wisconsin card sorting) has been widely adopted in the cognitive neuroscience community, their formulation for mainstream ML is nifty and allows for systematic empirical evaluation.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\nHaving said that, this paper fails to deliver on its promise of intricate analysis.\n(i) There is an inherent question that authors fail to sufficiently address. The selected \"cues\" for analysis have intrinsically different extraction demands from the stimuli, thus making the argument about them being \"equally prevalent\" moot. For example, accessing color is more direct (pixel-level information is directly available) than accessing, say, shape (for which a network needs to build sufficiently large receptive fields to understand the global geometry of a scene).\n\n(ii) The experiments on the UTKFace dataset are not convincing. The authors themselves acknowledge that there might be other \"shortcut cues\" outside of the selected ethnicity and age cues. This brings up a subtle (yet important) question. In naturalistic datasets, how can one determine or interpret a basis set of cues that are truly orthogonal dimensions? The experiments on WCST-ML work because the shape, color, scale, and orientation are by definition orthogonal. For all we know, the \"cues\" in naturalistic datasets could be abstract and not human-interpretable too.\n\n(iii) Treating the number of model parameters as a proxy for the Kolmogorov complexity of the input-output mapping seems ill-advised. If one trains a parameter-shared recurrent neural network it can perform the same effective computations as a ResNet, but with much fewer parameters (though the task per se has not changed, and by extension the cues). I would appreciate it if the authors can offer some insight into this.\n\nMinor:\n(i) Figures need to be made more legible. Axis labels and text insets are barely visible without zooming in.\n(ii) Particularly, Figure 4 could be refined further. The caption isn't very descriptive, and the section on \"Qualitative view on the loss surface\" is a bit misleading. The ethnicity solution doesn't seem to be \"characterized with a flatter and wider surface\" as compared to age and gender solutions in Fig. 4. If there are more obvious examples, the authors should use them instead. This is a well-written paper trying to address an important problem.

                "content": "The paper discusses biases in inductive learning in deep neural networks that stem from pathologically sampled data. The authors pose a problem set where a trainer only sees samples where two or more latent values can only be observed in a fully correlated fashion (e.g. scale, color, shape). They then design various criteria and protocols to gain insight in the behavior of the learned model when the correlation does not hold any more (i.e. samples that have not been seen in the training data). They conclude that in this case of generalization to unseen data, the trained model has an implicit bias towards choosing (1) mostly single cues to determine the predicted label (e.g. color only), (2) that more preferred cues are simpler than less preferred cues and (3) that the underlying solution space of possible parameters has more solutions that prefer the simple cues. They demonstrate empirical results on variations of existing datasets (DSprites, UTKFace).    The paper is written well, the claims are laid out clearly, and the method is largely well described. The approach seems methodically sound given the problem statement  (caveat in W2 below). The path of investigation is fundamentally valuable in the sense that models of biases and generalization of networks are helpful tools.\n\nWeaknesses:\n[W1] Some parts of the exposition need minor clarification:\n(a) p6: \"The trend is clear for ResNet20 and ViT, while the ethnicity and gender preferences are within the error bars for FFnet.\" This refers to Figure 3, and I cannot understand this from Figure 3, in the least it is confusingly stated.

For instance in the introductory example of section one/figure 1, the authors imply that the model is biased towards scale (then shape, then color). I do agree that this is consistent with the model preferring the property of scale in making the decision. Is this bias, though? In order to evidence bias, I'd need a truth/label assignment on the off diagonals (e.g. indicating that blue small triangle is not supposed to be class 1). Without this truth assignment I do not see the bias of the model.\n\n[W3] The main weakness of the paper seems to me that I am asking myself: What have I learned after reading the paper? I feel that the experiment setup is sound in the stated sense: what does the network learn if it only ever sees pathological samples (i.e. where all latent variables are exactly correlated). However, the presented answers that networks tend to learn simpler cues, where simpler can be measured by Kolmogorov complexity are not overly surprising or counter-intuitive. Perhaps the authors can rephrase the contributions more clearly towards the benefits? For instance: With the tools, analysis and exposure of this paper, what can I now see different, do different, etc. What are possible next steps where stronger impact is on the horizon? The paper addresses an important topic, but I feel that the overall impact, measured by depth of presented contributions is too shallow."

We are glad that the reviewer recognises the significance of the topic and the benefit of our approach and analysis. Now, let\u2019s focus on the weaknesses pointed out by the reviewer. The pointed weaknesses are great points too; we have been able to deepen the arguments in the paper thanks to the reviewer\u2019s comments.\n\n> There is an inherent question that authors fail to sufficiently address. The selected \"cues\" for analysis have intrinsically different extraction demands from the stimuli, thus making the argument about them being \"equally prevalent\" moot. For example, accessing color is more direct (pixel-level information is directly available) than accessing, say, shape (for which a network needs to build sufficiently large receptive fields to understand the global geometry of a scene).\n\nTo start, we\u2019d like to differentiate what we observe from what we control. We have used terminologies like below throughout the paper:\n- equally conducive\n- equally valid\n- equally plausible\n- equally correlates with the targets\n- equally represented\n\nThey synonymously indicate the condition that the *degrees of correlation with the target label* for every cue are *identical*. This is what we control. What we observe and analyse, instead, is that there are \u201cdifferent extraction demands\u201d for each cue, as seen by the highly skewed likelihood of each cue being chosen by a deep model.\n\nThe reviewer is totally right about the fact that cues do have different intrinsic easiness of accessibility. Our work is focused on exactly this phenomenon. For example, when comparing cues such as color vs shape, color recognition only necessitates reading off pixel values (i.e. \u201cpixel-level information is directly available\u201d), while shape recognition requires something far more complex. So color is indeed easier. However, the question becomes highly non-obvious for other cues, such as shape versus orientation, or in the case of UTKFace, Age vs Gender. Both are high-level concepts. How do we generalize the concept of certain information being \u201cmore directly available\u201d to an arbitrary pair of cues? \n\nThis is where the mathematical framework comes in. The mathematical tool in our case is the *Kolmogorov complexity (KC)*. We propose a formal way to characterise the \u201cdirect availability\u201d of a cue via its readiness to be represented by a simple model. That is, a cue is \u201cdirectly available\u201d if and only if a small model ($f$ with small $K(f)$) can already effectively memorise the cue pattern (i.e. achieve $\\mathcal{L}(f;X,Y)<\\delta$); see Equation 6. The benefit of this characterisation is that one can apply the KC concept to an arbitrary cue, as long as we have access to some labelled data for the cue (X-Y pairs).\n\n> In naturalistic datasets, how can one determine or interpret a basis set of cues that are truly orthogonal dimensions? The experiments on WCST-ML work because the shape, color, scale, and orientation are by definition orthogonal. For all we know, the \"cues\" in naturalistic datasets could be abstract and not human-interpretable too.\n\nThanks for raising this point. WCST-ML experiments do not require the cues to be orthogonal. The point we try to convey is that deep models prefer certain cues over others. On UTKFace, we have shown that the ethnicity cues are preferred to gender or age, without relying on the orthogonality of the cues. It is also important to point out that, within WCST-ML, human interpretability is also not a requirement. We need a much weaker assumption: that we can put integer cue labels on samples. In the extreme case, we may also define cues A and B on the dataset by uniform-sampling the labels (random noise labels) twice for each input. We may still compare a model\u2019s preference between the cues A and B defined through the respective (X,Y) samples by performing the identical analysis as we have in Section 3. In this work, we chose orthogonal (e.g. shape and color) and interpretable (e.g. gender and ethnicity) cues as an illustrative and meaningful example to the readers, but should labels be available, WCST-ML and its analysis can also be used for an entangled and non-interpretable set of cues. We believe we had not appropriately discussed these points in our previous version, and we have thus updated the paper with this discussion (Section 2.1, below Proposition 1).\n"

A crucial detail that we failed to emphasise in the submission is that we need to confine the computation of the number of parameters to a single model family. In our case, we have fixed the space of models to *ResNet20 with a varying number of channels* (Section 4, under paragraph \u201cMeasuring KCC\u201d).

This is more visible when viewed from the top (right plots for each cue). Albeit minute, we do see that the blue area is slightly wider for ethnicity than age and gender. We agree our description is quite strong, especially given the high subjectivity of the observation. We have fixed the description in the manuscript (Section 3.2, under paragraph \u201cQualitative view on the loss surface\u201d).

[1] has found that it is almost always possible to find a zero-loss **quadratic curve** between two solutions, while finding a zero-loss linear path is not as easy. A quadratic curve (more precisely a Bezier curve [1]) is parameterized with three points: two end points and the third point that determines the shape of the curve. In our plots, we have shown all three points as black dots, the zero-loss quadratic curve as the solid line, and the linear segment connecting the solutions as a dashed line (which does not guarantee zero loss). We have improved the explanation in the caption of Figure 6.\n\n[1] Garipov et al. Loss surfaces, mode connectivity, and fast ensembling of dnns.

In order to evidence bias, I'd need a truth/label assignment on the off diagonals (e.g. indicating that blue small triangle is not supposed to be class 1). Without this truth assignment I do not see the bias of the model.\n\nWe believe the description for Figure 1 and the related text have not been exceptionally clear in showcasing the focal takeaways in WCST-ML, and could have led to misinterpretations of the Figure. In Figure 1, we show objects which vary in shape, scale and color. In the diagonal examples, these object cues are fully correlated, thus we have a small-red-circle (label 1), a medium-green-triangle  (label 2), and a large-blue-square (label 3). In the lower right corner of the figure, instead of implying which cue the example model is biased towards, we instead only show different possible scenarios:\n- If we observe that $f$(small-blue-triangle) = 1, then we can infer that $f$ is biased to scale.\n- If $f$(small-blue-triangle) = 2, then $f$ is biased to shape.\n- If $f$(small-blue-triangle) = 3, then $f$ is biased to color.\n\nThis is to illustrate how, by experiment design, we can determine which cue the model $f$ has been biased towards by looking at the off-diagonal samples. As the reviewer said, it is possible to reveal the bias for $f$ **if and only if** you have access to off-diagonal samples. If such off-diagonal samples are furthermore labelled, then we can even make a judgment on the model, for example on whether the model is biased towards helpful cues or wrong cues.\n\nThanks to this comment we have revised the caption for Figure 1 and the related paragraph to clarify these important aspects and improve the overall presentation of WCST-ML."

                "content": " > [W3] The main weakness of the paper seems to me that I am asking myself: What have I learned after reading the paper? I feel that the experiment setup is sound in the stated sense: what does the network learn if it only ever sees pathological samples (i.e. where all latent variables are exactly correlated). However, the presented answers that networks tend to learn simpler cues, where simpler can be measured by Kolmogorov complexity are not overly surprising or counter-intuitive. Perhaps the authors can rephrase the contributions more clearly towards the benefits? For instance: With the tools, analysis and exposure of this paper, what can I now see different, do different, etc. What are possible next steps where stronger impact is on the horizon?\n\nMany thanks for this comment. The reviewer\u2019s concerns are well received, and we take it upon ourselves to improve the discussion and conclusion section to better explain the practical benefits deriving from the experiments in this work.\n\nThe current form of the paper is focused more on conceptual contributions. As the reviewer has summarized well, we show that shortcut learning may not only stem from the disparities in cues\u2019 statistical correlations to the target task but also from their very nature: cues have different inherent Kolmogorov complexities (KC). An interesting implication of our conceptual contribution is that our conclusion goes against the common wisdom in machine learning: given simple and complex solutions, it is better to choose the simple one (Occam\u2019s razor). There are common DNN-training recipes designed to encourage simpler solutions, such as stochastic gradient descent, dropout, stochastic depth, and weight decay. An immediate future work would be to re-assess their utilities when applied to de-biasing or fairness scenarios, as they may encourage unwanted shortcuts.\n\nThe less pronounced yet crucial contribution of this paper is the toolbox for analysis. We have introduced the measurement of KC for generic cues, which will correlate well with the models\u2019 preference for the cues. There is nothing that stops us from computing the KC even for real-world cues; the only requirement is access to samples labelled according to the cue of interest. The estimated KCs may be useful for many downstream applications. For example, one may optimize the needed amount of the off-diagonal samples to de-bias a model based on the KC estimates. This will be highly useful in practice for reducing the data collection costs; collecting or synthesising the off-diagonal samples is typically expensive as they would seldom appear in nature (e.g. trucks on lakes).\n\nThe combination of the mode-connectivity technique [1] and the bias analysis technique in our paper provides further avenues for future research directions. In our paper, we have used the mode-connectivity technique to find a path from a preferred solution to an averted one along which the original-task loss (i.e. diagonal loss) is effectively zero. A particularly successful application of the mode-connectivity technique has been the ensemble of models along the path to improving generalisation [1]. Such a path ensemble tends to generate a more diverse set of models than locally perturbing the solutions [1]. We can extend this idea further in our setup where the endpoints of the path correspond to solutions attending to different cues. Samples along such a heterogeneous curve are likely to be much more diverse and could result in a more effective ensemble. We may also control the type and amount of bias in the resulting ensemble by adjusting the concentration of sampling probabilities along the curve.\n\nAbove are only a subset of possible research directions that our analyses and tools may inspire. We have revised the manuscript to aid readers in quickly grasping the contributions and gaining insights like the above. Please take a look at the added \u201ctoolbox contribution\u201d paragraph in Section 5 that summarises the above possibilities. Let us know if the reviewer believes further improvement will be necessary - we will be happy to engage in further discussions and revisions.\n\n[1] Garipov et al.

                "content": " We thank the reviewer for providing a thorough review of the paper, for highlighting relevant and important aspects of this work, and for providing us with valuable feedback to improve its presentation and engage a wider audience.\n\nBelow we will address the main comments/concerns in order. \n\n> Averted solution or averted cues are not introduced, before being used in section 3.2. What is the difference between averted and preferred? Section 3.2 seems to imply that preferred solutions are computed by optimizing the model using D_diag and averted solutions computed using D_i for a specific property i that is not deemed preferred. Am I correct? If this is the case, it seems unreasonable to be comparing the two solutions directly (e.g. in Fig 4) since they are computed using datasets of different sizes.\n\nThank you for asking for clarifications. The notion of preferred versus averted cues (and solutions likewise) is relative. Given a pair of cues A and B, we determine which one is preferred and averted based on a model\u2019s tendency to learn one over the other when trained on the diagonal set $\\mathcal{D}_\\text{diag}$. We had not previously introduced the terms unequivocally before using them in Section 3.2. We have inserted this definition at the end of Section 3.1 and added appropriate text to clarify the use of \u201cpreferred\u201d and \u201caverted\u201d in the manuscript. \n\nIt is true that one could often obtain the preferred solution by simply training on the $\\mathcal{D}_\\text{diag}$. However, as the reviewer has pointed out, this will lead to an imbalance in the number of training data for the preferred and averted solutions, introducing an uncontrolled factor. Instead of doing this, we always use the union of the diagonal and off-diagonal sets, denoted $\\mathcal{D}_k$ (Equation 2), for finding both preferred and averted solutions. Though redundant, this ensures a fair comparison. We have updated the paragraph \u201cHow to find the averted solutions\u201d in Section 3.2 with this description.\n\n\n\n> In Fig 4, it also is not clear what the loss landscape represents. Section 3.2 mentions that it's the loss around averted and preferred solutions, but Figure 4 does not mention which ones are averted and which ones are preferred. Also, Figure 4 says that the two directions of parameter variation were chosen at random. Given the high dimensionality of DNN parameters, it would be much more informative to depict several of these plots per solution, to cover more directions of variation.\n\nAs \u201caverted\u201d and \u201cpreferred\u201d solutions are relative concepts, it is not possible to label each cue in Figure 4 as either \u201caverted\u201d or \u201cpreferred\u201d without reference points. Instead, we have sorted the cues in the descending order of preference. For example, scale is a preferred cue against orientation but is an averted cue against shape.\n\nIt will help the reader to further clarify that we use different datasets, and consequently different loss functions, for finding the solutions versus for plotting the loss landscape in Figure 4. For finding the solutions (the center of the X-Y plane for each plot in Figure 4), we use the union of diagonal and off-diagonal sets, or $\\mathcal{D}_k$; see also the response above. For plotting the loss values (loss landscape for each plot in Figure 4), we only use the diagonal set $\\mathcal{D}_\\text{diag}$, which is shared by all cues. It important to notice that the solutions found with each union set $\\mathcal{D}_k$ are still meaningful to the original task $\\mathcal{D}_\\text{diag}$. The solutions found with $\\mathcal{D}_k$ **are** simultaneously the solutions to $\\mathcal{D}_\\text{diag}$, by Corollary 3. In other words, we have discovered a diverse set of solutions for the task $\\mathcal{D}_\\text{diag}$ with the help of off-diagonal augmentation $\\mathcal{D}_k$ with different $k$\u2019s. Now, since all the plots in Figure 4 represent the loss values for the diagonal set $\\mathcal{D}_k$, we can directly compare the loss landscapes across the solutions biased to different cues. Following the reviewer comment, we have revised the Figure\u2019s caption to clarify this important aspect.\n\nThe main purpose of Figure 4 was to share our observations and some intuition with the readers. We decided that supplying multiple samples of the 3D plots in a paper was not the best use of the medium. Instead, after sharing the intuition in Figure 4, we have presented a quantitative version of the observations in Section 3.2 and Figure 5, where we measure the breadth of the basin of attraction for each solution type. The breadth is measured in terms of the mean across multiple directions.\n"

                "content": " > Section 4 provides evidence to the idea that certain cues have higher complexity than others. This is measured by searching for the smallest model that can memorize the training set. Color could be memorized by a model with only 1.2K parameters, and orientations needed 273 K parameters. A natural question is then whether large models present a less degree of biases towards simpler cues. As the parameter count increases, the solution set for the orientation task must also increase. It would be interesting to see if the model preference for more complex cues would also increase, or if solution sets for simpler cues would still dominate for very large models.\n\nGreat question. We believe this is a good chance to clear up our conclusions at different model sizes. Let us consider, for example:\n- Model **S**mall: 10K parameters\n- Model **L**arge: 1M parameters\n\nModel **S** is capable of representing color but not orientation. In the parameter space, there are color-biased solutions but no orientation-biased ones. \n\nModel **L** is fully capable of representing both color and orientation, with both types of solutions in the parameters space. Thus, the reviewer is correct to say that compared to model **S**, the larger model **L** has a greater volume of orientation-biased solutions in the parameter space.\n\nThe main setup the paper is concerned with is the models of type **L**, when a model is capable of representing both simple and complex cues. Our empirical and theoretical conclusion is that even with the stated capabilities, such models prefer simple cues. In the parameter space, color-biased solutions are exponentially more abundant than orientation-biased ones (Section 4, $p(f)\\lesssim 2^{-a\\widetilde{K}(f)+b}$). We expect it to be difficult to reverse models\u2019 natural inclinations towards simplicity by merely increasing the model size.\n\nWhat is not inferred from our studies is whether the preference to simple cues will become less glaring as the model size increases far beyond **L**. It would be a great finding if there is a continual increase in the relative volume of complex solutions in larger models. But at the same time, one needs to keep in mind that the relative volume of complex solutions is always bound to be exponentially smaller than that of simple solutions (Section 4, $p(f)\\lesssim 2^{-a\\widetilde{K}(f)+b}$).\n\n\n> Although the diagonal dataset construct is appropriate to see which cues are preferred by a model, in practice this construct rarely applies. Real data may present correlations similar to those found in the diagonal construct, but will also contain off-diagonal samples. Thus, an interesting analysis would be to measure how much you'd need to deviate from D_diag to obtain an \"averted solution\". In other words, if we train a model with (100-p)% diagonal samples and p% off-diagonal samples labelled according to cue i (e.g. labelled for orientation), how likely is the model to correctly predict cue i for increasing values of p?\n\nThank you for this interesting comment. The setup of the experiment is indeed purposefully extreme to let us understand the results better. The experiment proposed by the reviewer is very pertinent and practically meaningful. We expect to observe that an averted cue will require more off-diagonal samples (p%) to increase its ranking, and vice versa.\n\nAlthough pressed for a limited time, we are currently attempting to generate additional results following the reviewer\u2019s interesting thought experiment. We will include them in the supplementary materials should this be possible within the rebuttal deadline.\n"

Existing methods focus on addressing the representation limitation through learning the complete expressiveness, which is impractical and may deteriorate the performance in complex tasks. In this paper, we introduce the True-Global-Max (TGM) condition for linear and monotonic value decomposition to achieve the optimal consistency directly, where the TGM condition can be ensured under the unique stability of the optimal greedy action. Therefore, we propose the greedy-based value representation (GVR), which stabilises the optimal greedy action via inferior target shaping and destabilises non-optimal greedy actions via superior experience replay. We conduct experiments on various benchmarks, where GVR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Experiment results demonstrate that our method can meet the optimal consistency under sufficient exploration and is more efficient than methods with complete expressiveness capability."

                "content": "The paper addresses the problem of monotonic value representations for non-monotonic true values in MARL. The authors perform a theoretical analysis of the conditions under which the greedy decentralized policy coincides with the optimal joint policy and derive a novel update scheme to destabilize incorrect fix-points. They also introduce a priority replay buffer that selects transitions with optimal actions more often and thereby stabilizing learning further. The new algorithm GVR is tested on a matrix game, a predator-prey task and StarCraft II micromanagement tasks. In the latter two GVR appears to significantly outperform decentralized baselines.  \n The authors seem to attempt a deep theoretical analysis of the underlying problem and the good results on predator-prey and StarCraft II indicate that they have found an algorithm that should be definitely published. However, although the reviewer has published on this field, he/she was largely unable to follow the text and the derivations. While the text is technically well written, the underlying concepts are very unclear to the reviewer and the formulas are swapping notations. Finally the developed algorithm remained unclear to the reviewer, who is not sure how statements like (eq.6) can actually be implemented (the pseudo-code in the appendix did not help). In detail:\n\n(1) As far as the reviewer understands the field, the problem is that monotonic value function functions cannot represent non-monotonic true values. Rashid et al. (2020) have shown that putting more importance on optimal actions can resolve this issue and Gupta et al. (2021) have linked this to relative overgeneralization, showing that sampling optimal actions more often allows to learn the optimal policy. Both papers use matrix-games similar to Table 1 to motivate their approach. However, the reviewer was not able to connect these insights with the notion of a \"stable greedy action\". Which are those? Definition 3 uses the formulation \"a stable joint Q value function $Q(s,u)$ which has converged to the true Q value $\\mathcal Q^\\pi(s, u)$ under $\\pi(s, u)$\". Does this mean that $Q(s,u) = \\mathcal Q^\\pi(s, u)$? Is $Q$ factored? How are stability and factoredness related? This seems to be the central concept of GVR, but the reviewer has no idea how to connect it to the presented problem or the proposed solution.\n\n(2) The core of the ITS method seems to be (eq.6). How is it computed in practice, when the agent does not know $\\mathcal Q(s, u)$, which the reviewer assumes corresponds to $\\mathcal Q^\\pi(s, u)$? For the current action this could be approximated with the Bellman operator, but (eq.6) requires  the evaluation of $\\mathcal Q(s, u^*)$ as well. It would be generally helpful to differntiate between $u^*$ and $u_{opt}$ throughout the text, but in particularly here, where the agent does not know $u_{opt}$, but uses $u^*$ in (eq.6), which is confusingly defined as \"optimal\".\n\n(3) The formal derivation is at least sloppy. The authors introduce the Dec-POMDP framework where the policy $\\pi(u|\\tau)$ conditions on the action-observation histories, but then define the utilities $\\mathcal U^a(u^a, o^a)$ as conditioning only on the observations $o^a$, and the values $Q(u, s)$ as conditioning on the state. This does not work (see Oliehoek and Amato, 2016). Either work in a Dec-MDP, which ignores many interesting issues, or consistently condition on the histories $\\tau^a$ and not the state or observation.\n\n(4) The paper uses the term \"reward shaping\", but it seems the authors mean \"reward function\" (as in the matrix game experiments). This is very confusing, as GVR \"shapes\" the value-targets, which one could interpret as actual reward shaping, i.e., (here indirectly) changing the given reward function to improve performance.\n\n(5) (eq.8) insinuates that higher exploration noise will \"destabilize\" non-optimal stable greedy policies. How does this fit with the relative overgeneralization example in Gupta et al. (2021)?\n\n(6) The reviewer did not understand the conclusions the authors drew from the matrix game experiment. Both the setup (why are the rewards for most actions randomized? how is this a fair comparison?) and the results in Figure 2 (are there siginificant differences in return?). While Figure 1b seems to support the theoretical statement, it is unclear why the setup justifies this (e.g. what would happen if your random rewards are from another range than (-20,6)?). The paper seems to be onto something that would be of great interest to the community, and the good results indicate that the authors know what they are doing, but the paper is currently almost incomprehensible to this reviewer. Although the authors are welcome to refute or explain the above criticisms, the fact that the reviewer was not able to understand the core idea of the paper during the first reading makes it unlikely that he/she will recommend to publish it in the current form.

As a result, the converged joint Q values are not equal to the true Q value. Instead, they converge to the situations in Tab1(b) or Tab1(d). $Q$ is linearly (or monotonically) factorized. However, such factorization introduces representation limitation, which causes multiple stable points. We clarify Def.3 and present an example to explain the stability in Section 3.2 of resubmitted paper.\n\n\n2. Firstly, the reviewer is right about the assuming of $\\mathcal{Q}(s,u)$. For Eq.6 (Eq.5 in resubmitted version), we mistyped $Q(u^*,\\tau)$ with $\\mathcal{Q}(s,u^*)$, which has been revised in the resubmitted version. We denote the greed action with $u^*$ and optimal action with $u_{opt}$ throughout the paper, which is defined in the resubmitted preliminary.\n\n\n3-4.\t Thanks for your kind and insightful comments, we have revised these problems. In addition, to clarify our methods and derivations, we have modified the notations in the resubmitted version.\n\n\n5. In UneVEn, the authors analyze a special case (a well-shaped two-agent payoff matrix game) to support the idea that the convergence to the optimal joint action depends on the probability of the other agent's optimal action. The conclusion is consistent with our findings (Eq.7), where we consider a more general situation (n-agents, any reward function).\n\n\n6. We generate the matrices randomly for two reasons. First, our experiments on matrix games are carried out in a larger action space (up to $12^4$) than previous work, where the manual design of the matrix is time-consuming. Second, the non-optimal stable points depend on reward function (as verified in Appendix H), to evaluate whether a method can eliminate the non-optimal stable points (or ensure optimal consistency), we test this method under general (random) reward functions. To guarantee the fairness of comparison, We use the same set of seeds for all methods to generate the matrices (i.e., the generated matrices are the same for all methods).  The difference in return in figure 2 may be not significant, but we mainly concern the stability and optimality of evaluated methods. In figure 2, at the end of the training, our method converges to the optimal (return = 8) with little variance. The range of the random reward is not necessarily (-20,6), it can be any other range. As verified in the experiment on predator-prey, the reward function has little influence on our method."

Therefore, we denote the equations and appendixes of resubmitted version with $(R)$ (e.g., Appendix B(R)) in replies.\n\n1. The joint Q value function is the action-value function of the agent group, which is modeled by neural networks. The true Q value is the actual action-value of the agent group, which is the external criterion of the team's performance defined by the environment. The target of the joint Q value function is just the true Q value. \n\n2. For the question about Eq.3 (i.e., Eq.2 of Appendix B(R)), the utility function equals to the expectation on its target (e.g., $\\mathcal{Q}_{ik} - \\mathcal{U}_k^2$ is a target of $\\mathcal{U}_i^1$ with a probability $\\epsilon/m$). If we replace true Q values with the joint Q values,  according to Eq.1 of Appendix B(R), the equation still holds. In fact, the equation holds for both situations.\n\n3. Eq.13 in Appendix D (i.e., Eq.19 of Appendix D.2(R)) is acquired with the following steps: (1) refer to the expression of the utility function in Eq.2 (Appendix B.1(R)); (2) replace all true Q values of actions except the greedy action and $u_s$ with the target $(1-\\alpha)Q(u^*, \\tau)$; (3) combine the terms containing utility functions and use the mapping $f$ to represent it. The accurate expression of the mapping $f$ is very complicated, which is unnecessary because it would be canceled out by a subtraction (Eq.23, Appendix D.2(R)). We also provide proof without the mapping $f$ in Appendix D.1(R).\n\nFor Eq.18 in appendix E, we update the proof to n-agent situation. The high-level idea is to represent the utility function with the expectation on different kinds of samples (i.e., inferior, current and greedy). Please refer to Appendix E.1(R) for the details. \n\n4. The critic is designed to distinguish whether an action is better than the current greedy action.

The paper identifies limitations with previous linear/monotonic forms of the decomposition, in particular that the joint greedy action (which matches the greedy joint action for these decompositions) might not match the maximum true Q value. This condition is termed \"True-Global-Max\", and the paper introduces two techniques (inferior target shaping, superior experience replay) to satisfy this condition and improve upon previous suggested Q-value decompositions in literature. The paper walks through a toy matrix game example, a predator-prey experiment, and the Starcraft Multi-Agent challenge environment. Strengths:\nThe problem that is being studied is of high importance, given the popularity of the value decomposition baselines (VDN and QMIX). The True-Global-Max condition is interesting, and the paper proposes relatively simple techniques to satisfy the condition, which is a plus. The experiments are also interesting and the ablation studies in the supplemental are informative. I found the derivations and the writing easy to read, and overall I think the paper can be a good contribution. \n\nSome questions I have:\n- Def 3 and Tab1: the condition says that the joint Q function has converged to the true Q function under policy \\pi. But in Table 1 it seems that none of the Q functions have converged to the true Q function (Tab 1a)? Could you please clarify Def 3 (I'm not sure why we can't just write Eq5 in terms of argmax Q^\\pi = argmax \\pi\n- Is the joint interactive policy \\pi fixed? Or is it updating as the estimated Q function updates? I assume it is updating, but that also seems to mean Eq5 will always hold?\n- For inferior target shaping (ITS), we are penalizing non-optimal actions. The high-level idea is to have a large enough epsilon\\*penalty so that the agents can realize that there is a better alternative action, right? But it is unclear to me why we don't just need that epsilon\\*penalty > 0, it seems that if there is just a little improvement then over time the value iterations will converge to the better alternative? Overall I found the problem important, and the paper interesting (both technical and experimental parts) and easy to read.

                "content": "This paper aims to improve value-factorization in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning settings under centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) framework. The proposed method (GVR) attempts to ensure both Individual-Global-Max(IGM) and True-Global-Max(TGM) conditions without learning a completely expressive (CEC) value function (which can represent all joint- actions). IGM ensures the consistency between joint action selection and local greedy action selection (Individual-Global-Max, IGM), and TGM ensures that the joint-action value function correctly represents optimal values. The GVR method proposed by the authors claims to ensure both IGM and TGM conditions without CEC.\n\nThe main contribution is greedy-value based representation (GVR) which consists of two parts. First, Inferior Target Sampling (ITS) ensures that the greedy joint action is stable such that if the greedy action corresponds to the optimal joint action, then for other joint actions, the gradient will be negative, thereby selectively focusing on representing the unique optimal joint action. If the greedy action does not correspond to the unique optimal joint action, then higher exploration is required in order to destabilize it. However, the lower bound for exploration can become quite high (close to 1) with increasing agents/joint action space, therefore the authors propose a prioritized experience replay buffer. The prioritized buffer assigns higher priority to non-greedy actions which have higher values than a state-based critic.\n\nExperimental results on matrix game, predator-prey and hard/super-hard maps from Starcraft II benchmark show improvements over baseline methods.\n ### Strengths:\n\n* The ideas in the paper are novel, and experimental results validate the equations as well. Moreover, the ITS method is based on a proof and can guarantee the stability of greedy actions.  \n* The experimental results on some super hard SMAC maps like 6h_vs_8z (known to be a hard exploration map) look impressive compared to other state of the art methods like QMIX, QPLEX.\n* The paper is well motivated as both IGM and TGM conditions are essential for stability and learning coordinated policies, and can be especially helpful for non-monotonic tasks. \n\n### Weaknesses:\n\n* ITS can keep the greedy action stable which works great if the greedy action is already optimal. However, the authors rely on superior experience replay to destabilize the non-optimal greedy actions. I have some major concerns about this and would request authors to clarify the following:\n\n\t- Looking at Algorithm 1 in appendix, it is unclear how the agent loss is computed. If the Q value of an action $u$ is greater than the greedy action $u^\\star$ i.e. $Q(s,u) > Q(s,u^\\star)$, then it seems like the error would be zero as $Q^{its}(s,u) = Q(s,u)$. Does this rely on the greedy action always being the optimal joint action through higher exploration rate or superior experience replay? \n\n\t- Similarly, the update for the critic is a bit unclear as well. Why is the critic loss only updated for superior samples? It makes sense to consider the samples with $Q(s,u) > V(s)$ or $u = u^\\star$ as superior samples, but in the beginning of the training, the $Q(s,u) < V(s)$ can happen for samples with true optimal joint actions as well, but the critic loss will not be updated for them. \n \n* The paper is a bit hard to follow in certain areas, especially Section 5.1. It would be great if the authors could take some time to add more details to the paper as follows.\n\n\t- In Section 5.1, the authors can make it easier to understand what VDN+ITS variant refers to. \n\t- The paper sometimes refer to $u^\\star$ as optimal greedy  joint action (in Section 4.1), and then refer to $u^\\star$ as just greedy joint action in section 5.1 which is a bit confusing.\n\t- Should Equation (3) have $Q_{ik}$ and $Q_{kj}$ instead of $Q_{ki}$ and $Q_{jk}$?\n\n* One weakness of this paper is that the experimental section is missing  some important baselines. The destabilization of the non-optimal greedy actions through the superior replay buffer is interesting, but the authors should empirically compare against other efficient exploration based MARL approaches such as [1,2,3,4]. Although these approaches also cannot guarantee both IGM and TGM, they can potentially also alleviate the destability associated with stable non-optimal greedy actions via different exploration mechanisms. \n\n* I have a major concern about the performance of WQMIX reported on the StarCraft II benchmark map 6h_vs_8z. The reported performance is not consistent with that reported in the WQMIX paper (see Figure 4 in [5]). WQMIX paper also uses the same exploration schedule as this paper i.e. $\\epsilon$ annealed over 1e6 time steps. The original paper reports a median test win rate of around 80% with optimistic weighting but this paper only reports around 20%. Also, there seems to be only a single seed used for evaluating GVR on 6h_vs_8z. \n\n* The authors seem to have skipped a few super hard SMAC maps such as corridor, 27m_vs_30m and 3s5z_vs_3s6z which are important to determine the scalability of their approach with more agents.\n\n* The code is missing from the submission for reproducibility.\n\n### References:\n\n[1] Wang, Tonghan, et al. \"Influence-based multi-agent exploration.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1910.05512 (2019).\n\n[2] Liu, Iou-Jen, et al. \"Cooperative exploration for multi-agent deep reinforcement learning.\" International Conference on Machine Learning.

As a route to better discover and fix model bugs, we propose failure scenarios: regions on the data manifold that are incorrectly classified by a model. We propose an end-to-end debugging framework called Defuse to use these regions for fixing faulty classifier predictions. The Defuse framework works in three steps. First, Defuse identifies many unrestricted adversarial examples--naturally occurring instances that are misclassified--using a generative model. Next, the procedure distills the misclassified data using clustering into failure scenarios. Last, the method corrects model behavior on the distilled scenarios through an optimization based approach. We illustrate the utility of our framework on a variety of image data sets. We find that Defuse identifies and resolves concerning predictions while maintaining model generalization."

Engaging users in the training of classifiers has its advantages and disadvantages. For example, it can make easier to create \u201cpersonalised\u201d classification models that could be applied, e.g. in recommender system or information retrieval, where finding a perfect item depends on user\u2019s subjective perception of certain qualities. At the same time, user involvement in the training process can be tricky if it requires expert judgment as they may not always be available (as the authors demonstrated in the case of their third dataset consisting of German traffic signs). Further, involving user generated assessments requires well defined procedures in terms of requirement of assessors, determining the appropriate number of assessors, resolving disagreements between assessors, to ensure robustness of the final classifier. In the examples provided in the paper, the authors state that they used 5 workers (annotators) and the majority vote was used to decide the final label. What was the inter-annotator agreement?

The *identification* phase is based on clustering classification failure regions in a GAN latent space and the *correction* phase is based on fine-tuning the classifier with additional synthetic samples from the GAN.\n\nThe proposed method is strongly based on Zhao et al 2018 (Generating Natural Adversarial Examples), a method to generate on-manifold black-box adversarial examples using a GAN. The authors of the current paper describe some differences of their identification step from Zhao et al (end of section 3.2.1), but in my opinion they are minor.\n\nThe main contribution of the current paper over Zhao et al seems to be clustering the adversarial examples (using GMM) and using them to fine-tune the classifier. This, in my opinion, is potentially an interesting idea, however, the authors do not show sufficient evidence of its success. Specifically, the authors claim to \"achieve near perfect failure scenario accuracy with minimal change in test set accuracy\", but they do not provide any details (e.g. table of accuracy values on the train, test and adversarial sets before and after the fine-tuning). I would also expect to see an ablation study comparing the proposed method to simply including the adversarial examples found using Zhao et al (w/o GMM fitting and sampling) as additional training example - a standard adversarial defense approach (see e.g. [1]).\n\nPerhaps more importantly, the objective of the proposed method is not, in my opinion, clear. The title and abstract describe the goal as \"debugging\" a classifier and correcting fail regions, however the described method seems like a defense against on-manifold adversarial attack. If the method, as claimed, helps debugging and correcting the classifier, I would expect to see an improved accuracy on the (natural) unseen test set - not just on the synthetically generated adversarial examples.\n\nThe quality and clarity of the writing can be improved as well. A lot of space is allocated to describing well-known methods (e.g. VAE, GMM), however, critical information about the experimental results are missing. I'm also not sure all the formally defined algorithms and equations actually help in the understanding (e.g. algorithm 1, equation 2).

The most problematic point, in my opinion, is the only-marginal improvement on the test data, indicating that the suggested training method only improves the specific \"failure scenarios\", making it is similar to adversarial training methods used to gain adversarial robustness. However, the abstract and introduction indicates that the paper helps in debugging in fixing failures in general, which, I think should have been evident in improved test accuracy.\n\n[1] Zhang, Hongyang, et al. \"Theoretically principled trade-off between robustness and accuracy.\" ICML 2019"

Reduce the description of known methods (VAE+GMM) and focus the writing more on our contributions.\n3. Provide more samples from the failure scenarios in figure 3 in the main text.  We emphasize one of our main contributions is the identification of failure scenarios.  The failure scenarios are useful because they summarize the unrestricted adversarial examples into key failure trends in the model.  We bring greater emphasis to this in the paper by highlighting more examples.\n3. Compare Defuse to fine tuning on the unrestricted adversarial examples as a baseline (per Reviewer 3's recommendation).  We highlight the Defuse finetuning and baseline results in tabular form in figure 4.  We see that Defuse improves the accuracy on the failure scenarios considerably compared to before finetuning and the baseline.\n4. Provide analysis of the annotator agreement in section 4.4.  We see the annotators voted for the majority label on average 85.2% and 82.1% of the time for MNIST and SVHN respectively across the annotated unrestricted adversarial examples. \n\nWe also note we had an issue with data storage that effected the MNIST experiments.

We add results finetuning only on the unrestricted adversarial examples.  The results can be found in figure 4.  We find the accuracy on the failure scenario testing data is considerably higher using Defuse than finetuning on the unrestricted adversarial examples.\n\n\u201cPerhaps more importantly, the objective of the proposed method is not, in my opinion, clear.\u201d \n\n- The objective of our work is to systematically find and correct model bugs. Defuse helps to do this through both identifying trends in misclassified data and offers a route to correct the predictions on such data.  See for instance figure 3 in our paper. In the upper right hand corner, a certain style of skinny 6\u2019s are misclassified as 1\u2019s.  This result is insightful for a model designer because it indicates the model struggles with very skinny numbers. Further, our finetuning results demonstrate we can adequate correct the model predictions on these mistakenly classified data indicating Defuse also successfully corrects the fault predictions.\n\n\u201cI would expect to see an improved accuracy on the (natural) unseen test set - not just on the synthetically generated adversarial examples.\u201d\n\n- The test set accuracy marginally improves for MNIST and marginally decreases for SVHN and German signs (figure 4).  We point out however that the important aspect of our work is that accuracy on the failure scenarios (which we have confirmed are model bugs through human verification) are corrected.  We see this is the case with Defuse.\n\n\u201cThe quality and clarity of the writing can be improved as well..\u201d\n\n- The reviewer is right to point out there a number of places to improve.  We have reduced the emphasis on VAE + GMM background and added more experimental details.

In response to the reviewer\u2019s points, we\u2019ve significantly improved the experimental detail in the paper. \n\nThe choice of certain algorithms and their parameters needs to be justified clearly:\n\n- We better justify the use of the Dirichlet process GMM in section 3.2.2. We point out there are two main requirements with our approach.  First, we must be able to infer the number of clusters from the data.  Second, we must be able to sample new instances from each of the clusters.  Both these requirements greatly limit the clustering approaches we can use. We use the Dirichlet process GMM because the dirichlet process nicely models the clustering problem where the number of clusters in unknown ahead of time satisfying our first criteria.  Additionally, we can sample new instances from the clusters satisfying our second criteria.  Though it could be possible to propose other bayesian clustering methods that meet both these criteria, we focus on evaluating Defuse with this particular choice of clustering method and leave evaluating other clustering methods up to future work.\n\nThe paper should be rewritten to have sufficient details of experiments in the text rather than delegating them to the Appendix A:\n\n- We\u2019ve moved many of the Defuse details from the appendix to section 4.1.  We additionally add further justification to our parameter choices.\n\nThe motivation of why certain parameters are chosen for experiments should be discussed. For example, \"we sample 10 instances from each cluster in the distillation step. We ask 5 workers to label the instance\" -- Why are these choices appropriate?\n\n- We\u2019ve added additional justification for our annotation choices in section 4.1.  In addition, we\u2019ve better motivated our parameter choices throughout section 4 in general. In response to this specific question, it is usually apparent the classifier disagrees with many of the ground truth labels within 10 instances, and thus, it is appropriate to label the cluster as a failure scenario.  For example, in figure 3 it is generally clear the classifier incorrectly predicts the data within only a few examples. Thus, 10 instances is a reasonable choice.  We ask 5 workers to label the instance in order to reduce the noise in the annotation process. \n\nDescription of the annotation task ought to be more detailed -- \"labeling them ourselves\" -- Who constitutes \"ourselves\"? \n\n- For MNIST and SVHN, we use annotator labels.  For German signs, we, the authors reviewed and assigned the failure scenarios.  Though this is less rigorous than the MNIST and SVHN experiments, it is still useful to see the classifier bugs exposed with Defuse.\n\nWhat is the agreement between the annotators?\n\n- We add section 4.4 describing the annotator agreement during labeling.  We generally find the annotators were in agreement about the labels.  For MNIST, the annotators voted for the majority label on average 85.2% of the time and 82.1% for SVHN over all the unrestricted adversarial examples.\n\nWe would appreciate any further reviewer comments or questions from the reviewer to the above responses and revisions. \n"

While various types of defense methods (e.g., adversarial training, detection and rejection, and recovery) were proven empirically to bring robustness to the network, their weakness was shown by later works. Inspired by the observation from the distribution properties of the features extracted by the CNNs in the feature space and their link to robustness, this work designs a novel training process called Manifold-Aware Training (MAT), which forces CNNs to learn compact features to increase robustness.  The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated via comparisons with existing defense mechanisms, i.e., the TRADES algorithm, which has been recognized as a representative state-of-the-art technology, and the MMC method, which also aims to learn compact features. Further verification is also conducted using the attack adaptive to our method. Experimental results show that MAT-trained CNNs exhibit significantly higher performance than state-of-the-art robustness."

                "content": "Summary:\nThis paper tackles the problem of training models that are robust to adversarial inputs. The authors starts by observing that previous models generate embeddings that can both (i) place same-class embeddings in different clusters and (ii) different-class embeddings in close proximity. They then introduce new loss functions that penalize these behaviors and design a training procedure (MAT) around these new losses. Finally, they show favorable performance of MAT compared to state-of-the-art techniques for addressing adversarial robustness.\n\nReasons for score:\nOverall, I vote for accepting. Training adversarially robust models is an important problem, and the paper\u2019s experimental validation that the features of prior methods (TRADES) exhibit (i) non-clustering and (ii) confusing distance motivates the approach they take. The loss functions are explicitly designed to combat these issues, and the experimental results clearly show the favorability of the MAT procedure. In addition, the ablation study of the various components of the loss functions also adds some insight into the results. The paper is also very well written.\n\nCons:\nIt would be of interest to have some theoretical justification for the approach. Regarding the loss functions, it seems that BIBO should be a consequence of penalizing FTC loss and SO loss, and should not be explicitly needed (this is also somewhat consistent with the results of Table 2). Finally, some of the experimental results can be explored further. For example, in the ablation study, some of the experiments perform better without one of the loss functions, and it may help to explain such behavior. \n\nClarity / Typos:\nThe paper is very well written. A couple of minor points:\nFeature compactness - Maybe explain this phrase better in the introduction (explained well in Section 3 introduction)\nEqn 1: Maybe write J(f(x), y) and J(f(x), f(x\u2019)) instead\n"

For one, the core part of this defense by Pang et al. was broken by [1] which is not mentioned here. More importantly, the adversarial attacks employed here are not suited for finding minimal adversarial perturbations against the proposed defense. This can be seen most clearly in Figure 2 (or Table 10 in the appendix): If we allow a perturbation with L-infinity norm of 0.5 on MNIST, then we can always find an adversarial perturbation simply by setting the whole image to a flat gray value of 0.5. In turn, any effective adversarial attack should drive network performance down to at least random baseline performance (10%) for epsilon = 0.5. Instead, the paper reports > 99% accuracy for this value under a PGD attack, which means that PGD is totally ineffective against the given defense and a very different adaptive attack would be needed to accurately measure its robustness. Similarly, in Table 3 the attack success of targeted attacks is often higher than for untargeted attacks, again a clear sign for ineffective attacks. The work also uses an adaptive attack which works better for some versions of MAT but performs similar to PGD in other cases. Hence, the adaptive attack employed here are not good enought.\n\nThe reason why the proposed attacks fail against the defense are probably simple: for one, the attacks optimise a different classificatioon loss then what is actually used by the model. Second, both auxiliary losses may give rise to gradient masking, the most common issue for gradient-based attacks to fail against a defense. I highly suggest the authors study [1] to get familiar with how to engineer strong adaptive attacks.\n\n[1] On Adaptive Attacks to Adversarial Example Defenses, Florian Tramer, Nicholas Carlini, Wieland Brendel, Aleksander Madry, NeurIPS 2020, https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08347"

The authors compare MAT against the state-of-the-art in\ndefenses against adversarial evasion attacks (i.e., TRADES and MCC) and\nshow their approach outperforms it.\n\n# Strengths\n\n+  Interesting intuition of performing training \"in the\" manifold\n+  Interesting intuition to support SO and BIBO losses\n\n# Weaknesses\n\n-  Lack of comparison with a similar approach\n-  Lack of conclusive remarks / actionable points\n\n# Comments\n\nI praise the authors intuition of exploring the possibility of training\na classifier by exploiting knowledge of the manifold - its immediate\nimplication is that of focusing on lower dimensions of compact features\nthat would be more robust to manipulation (and thus adversarial\nattacks). I also particularly appreciate the threat model and the fact\nthe approach is evaluated in a white-box setting, according to Carlini\net al. (2019). While the authors' intuition is interesting, I wonder how\neasy this is to achieve in practice. In general, we have no knowledge of\nthe underlying manifold and I thus wonder what guarantees this approach\nwould provide. The results seem to show no clear loss-dependent trend\nand I thus wonder whether we can easily draw conclusive remarks. (For\ninstance, should we use SO and BIBO always? From a theoretical\nperspective, it seems so, but experiments seem to show otherwise.)\n\nFigure 1 is interesting as it shows that the representative features of\nsame-class samples are not always similar to one another. Wasn't this\nalready explored in Szegedy et al.? Perhaps not visually, but the fact\nthat objects close in the input space get eventually separated in the\nlatent space across the layers of the CNN is quite known. Also, a\nsimilar approach to the authors' proposal seems to be explored by Crecchi\net al. [1]. It would be interesting to compare and position MAT against\nthis.\n\n## Additional Comments\n\nIn Section 3.2, the authors propose two auxiliary loss functions to\nfurther improve the robustness of MAT. I wonder whether the BIBO loss\nwould just suffice for the purpose, instead of relying on the\nsecond-order loss too. I appreciate the explanation in Section 3.2.3 but\nit would be interesting to understand how one should expect to tune\nalpha and beta accordingly. \n\nResults on CIFAR10 seem less stable than compared to those on MNIST. In\nparticular, there is no trend that shows that relying on SO and BIBO on\na clean dataset provides better results than with a plain FTC loss:\n94%->85%->95%->83%; why the 95%? Is that expected? Similar reasoning\ncan actually be applied to MNIST too when one looks at PGD:\n61%->99%->82->99; why 82%? Is this expected? In contrast, TRADES seem to\nshow an expected trend (even when BIBO loss is considered).\n\nThe authors rely on the library 'foolbox' - my impression was that\ncleverhans [2] represented the state-of-the-art when it comes to\nexperimenting with adversarial ML attacks. What advantages does foolbox\nhave compared to cleverhans?\n\nAlthough off-topic for this work, it would be interesting to understand\nwhether MAT would be beneficial in defending against adversarial attacks\nthat consider realizable attacks (in the problem space). Figure 2 shows\nthe stability of MAT robustness for increasing values of perturbations.\nAdversarial attacks in the problem-space might need to consider\nadditional constraints while being non-necessarily constrained in a\nlp-norm [3].\n\n[1] Crecchi et al.

We show theoretically that the exact solution space is invariant with respect to automorphisms of the underlying probability spaces, and, furthermore, that the group of automorphisms acts freely and transitively on the space of exact solutions. We examine the case of zero pure CycleGAN loss first in its generality, and, subsequently, expand our analysis to approximate solutions for extended CycleGAN loss where identity loss term is included. In order to demonstrate that these results are applicable, we show that under mild conditions nontrivial smooth automorphisms exist. Furthermore, we provide empirical evidence that neural networks can learn these automorphisms with unexpected and unwanted results.

While the question addressed is important, the theory presented here does not seem to hint to a solution, hence I am keeping my score.    \n\n###\nSummary of the paper: \n\nThis paper shows that the cycle GAN loss suffers from the presence of lot of symmetries that make the existence of a unique solution not possible , and moreover adding a regularizer that uses the identity loss is not enough to make the problem less prone to those invariances. \n\nReview of the paper: \n\nThe notations and the formalism  in the paper are heavy and cumbersome and don't come with any surprising result, since the transforms between unpaired spaces will be found always up to   symmetries since we have the composition of one map with another. The use of the identity loss is also shown to not to help either in fixing this invariance issue. \n\nExperiments are not interesting since without any structure on the map of F and G , the source domain and the target domain, one is expected to get permutations.\n\nThe paper points in the conclusion  that the use of skipconnection in F and G has the major influence.\n\n The study of cycle GAN might need some assessment of what is the mutual information between the domains , as on what  information needs be preserved , and information needs to match , skip connection maintain the content in image generation as the information is kept from lower layer and its modified to target the style of the target images. \n\nAn information theoretic analysis of cycle gan is needed using for example the objective of \"MISO: Mutual Information Loss with Stochastic Style Representations for Multimodal Image-to-Image Translation\". \nor by using a radically new approach  for cycle gan such as the Gromov Wasserstein distance as done in \" Learning Generative Models Across Incomparable Spaces\"\n"

Proposition 2.1 provides interesting insights into the invariance of the kernel space. \n\n- Propositions 2.5 and 2.6 are interesting in that they show that the existence of authomorphisms can worsen the performance of CycleGAN, however, it is unclear that in practice, how could one verify the conditions efficiently before applying CycleGAN.\n\n- The experimental results are interesting, however, they are very limited. Having a toy experiment is a good sanity check, but it would be more interesting to see the performance on a real-world applications, such as medical images or other use-cases brought in the introduction. Also, more discussion on the results provided in Fig 3, confusion matrices, would be very helpful. Are there any intuitions behind the large and low values in the table? It could be interesting to see what are the effects of other parameters such as alpha in producing the results. \n\n- Overall this paper presents interesting results regarding the theory of CycleGANs, however, the numerical results are very limited, and do not justify the motivations discussed in the introduction and the abstract. Moreover, although the paper introduces novel attempts and theoretically analyzing the CycleGAN, the scope of the work seems to be limited, and thus, it does not have a sufficient significance to be published in ICLR. I strongly suggest the authors to expand and provide more experimental evaluations.\n\n** update:\nThanks for your comments! I found the additional experiment useful and better aligned with the purpose of the model. The discussion added clarified the confusion about the automorphism.

                "content": "Thank you very much for your feedback and additional references, this is very interesting!\n\nWe opted to use the measure theory language because the language of probability distributions is not flexible enough to accomodate commonly occurring distributions, e.g. those (strictly) supported on lower dimensional manifolds. Unless we require the PDF explicitly to have some symmetries, it is not clear why the corresponding probability space would have any smooth automorphisms at all. Thus we show that the existence of automorphisms is a very general property, and in the setup of e.g. latent space with spherical Gaussian PDF we show that there are smooth automorphisms as well.\n\nWe would like to point out that the goal of the paper is to provide a well-grounded and mostly self-contained analysis for the basic CycleGAN approach and to analyze theoretically the effect of the commonly used identity loss, along with some experiments to justify the claims. While the problem of multiple solutions for the CycleGAN is commonly realised, a good theoretical explanation for this is lacking in ML literature. \n\nNaturally, there are other approaches to unsupervised image-to-image translation with different losses and architectures. While analyzing all of them in a single paper is not realistic, we think that the philosophy we suggest in this paper can help researchers better understand the potential and the limitations of these newer image-to-image translation models. The underlying automorphisms can always pose a problem, and the question then becomes if a new loss/new architecture explicitly restricts this set.\n\nWe have added some additional experiments on BRATS 2015 dataset. In this set of experiments we will show how the loss and PSNR (since we have a ground truth) change when we vary the weight for identity loss. We introduce a (approximate) probability automorphism in the form of left/right flips and show that this highly unwanted transformation still obtains low loss values unless an identity loss is used.\n\nWe have also added a discussion about the MISO paper you suggested, where we hypothesize that the MISO approach does not 'solve' the issue of unwanted automorphisms, but rather restricts the set of these automorphisms to those that leave the style of the image fixed. Therefore the amount of uncertainty in this solution is connected to the capacity of the style encoder, and should ideally be quantified. When some important style content is present - e.g., anatomical landmarks - it seems reasonable that one should make sure that the style encoder learns this information. We think it is a an interesting question for future work. \n"

This is in line with our expectations since the domains are identical and the identity loss should trivially remove the ambiguity. The high values in the confusion matrix correspond to the digit class which is very definitive, and the smaller ones correspond to the cases when the digit class is somewhat ambiguous. It can be for instance digit \u20182\u2019 which is written a bit like \u20186\u2019 with a closed loop in the bottom, and it happens with digits '3', '5', '8' as well. \n\nFollowing your feedback, we have added some additional experiments on the BRATS 2015 dataset with medical images. In this set of experiments we show how the loss and PSNR (since we have a ground truth available) change when we vary the weight for identity loss, and we compare these values with flipped version of the image. We see that in the absence of identity loss the final CycleGAN loss is very similar for both original and flipped network output, while the PSNR drops significantly for the flipped version. Increasing the identity loss weight does not always result in improved performance in terms of PSNR.\n\nWe have  also added additional discussion of some newer image-to-image translation models from the 'automorphism point of view', and we hope that some of the questions we pose can be answered in future work.\n"

The Koopman operator theory lays the foundation for identifying the nonlinear-to-linear coordinate transformations with data-driven methods. Recently, researchers have proposed to use deep neural networks as a more expressive class of basis functions for calculating the Koopman operators. These approaches, however, assume a fixed dimensional state space; they are therefore not applicable to scenarios with a variable number of objects. In this paper, we propose to learn compositional Koopman operators, using graph neural networks to encode the state into object-centric embeddings and using a block-wise linear transition matrix to regularize the shared structure across objects. The learned dynamics can quickly adapt to new environments of unknown physical parameters and produce control signals to achieve a specified goal. Our experiments on manipulating ropes and controlling soft robots show that the proposed method has better efficiency and generalization ability than existing baselines."

Linear control theory - although it is quite natural to add the control as a linear affect in the latent space, and this has been done numerous times before in the literature, I don't recall there to be any theory on Koopman embedding when there is a control signal. Additionally, if the policy that has been used in practice is stochastic, the resulting \"induced\" dynamical system then also becomes stochastic, and to my knowledge, at least in theory, learning Koopman embedding for such systems has more challenges are requires certain assumptions about the true system, such as co-diagonalization and few others. I think this should be discussed in more detailed by the authors (and please do correct me if I'm wrong on any of these statements) as currently for the readers who are not too familiar I think the text might come across as though that the Koopman theory extends naively to these scenarios as well, which I do not think is the case.\n\n3. It is not very clear how does the \"metric\" loss affects the solution. I would encourage the authors to provide comparison (only in terms of dynamical modelling, without active control) of whether this metric helps, or have some negative effects on the prediction. I think that for instance if the GNN has some form of weight regularization than this indeed would have some non-trivial effect on the resulting representation. Also, it would useful to have plots of how accurately does the embedding preserve the distance to the true states in order to understand this better.\n\n\n\nComments on the experiments:\n\n1. In the paper there is no discussion about what are the actual observation space of the environments, could these be clarified better.\n\n2. The block diagonal structure approach in general has been presented as working with multiple types of interactions. However, in practice it seems that the authors have only used two types of interaction -> object-same-object and object-other-object interaction. This however, has never been discussed and is maybe false. Could you clarify these details?\n\n3. The results showed in Figure 3 are somewhat in contrast than the results in the original PN paper, specifically the PN paper states that it can achieve MSE of 7.85 for 1000 time steps, and from figure 6 of that paper it shows about 0.05 MSE over 100 steps on a similar rope environment. These results compared to the one presented here in Figure 3 makes me wonder how well did the authors actually managed to reimperilment the IN and PN paper? Could there be any comments on this as this makes many claims of the proposed method being better questionable and hard to understand its significance in relation to previous work. \n\n4. For the control tasks, it would have been useful to have more than just the single baseline used. There are plenty of algorithms for Reinforcement Learning that could have been used in order to put the method in perspective. E.g. one can apply MPC with ground-truth model (e.g. the simulator) to show the discrepancy with an ideal case. In the RL literature there are plenty of methods for solving smaller problems, parametric and non-parametric: Q-learning, PPO etc... I think this is very important from the reader perspective. \n\n\nPS: Please refer to the discussion below with the authors as I have increased my score from 3 to 6."

Extending the approach to objects with different properties.\n\nOur current model can naturally handle objects with different properties by treating interactions having different physical properties as different interactions. For example, our model will treat springs with different stiffness as different interactions. It would be an interesting future direction to exploring formulations that can further reduce the parameter by grouping similar interactions. For example, the matrix blocks representing spring relations with different stiffness can share a similar structure. \n\n2. Details on the training procedure.\n \nOur model is trained end-to-end. In every optimization step, we first use least-square regression to fit the Koopman matrix K and control matrix L, which are then used to calculate the loss functions. We then update the parameters in the graph encoder and decoder by backpropagating the gradient from the loss. \n\n3. Details on the MPC procedure.\n\nIn our MPC process, we re-evaluate the control after 32 steps. It is mainly due to the trade-off between the time used for control synthesis and the accuracy of the control result. In our three environments, our learned model is accurate enough that doing open-loop control gives reasonably accurate results. The benefits of replanning more frequently than once every 32 steps are marginal. \n\n4. Computational time used for online adaptation.\n\nThe statement in the introduction that \u201cour model is 20 times faster when adapting to new environments of unknown physical parameters\u201d is referring to the time used to do the online adaptation. The evaluation is performed in the Rope environment. Our model takes 0.43 +/- 0.11 seconds to identify the transition matrices using least-square regression while the IN/PN model needs 8.9 +/- 1.2 seconds for running 500 iterations of gradient descent using a learning rate of 1e-5. The statistics reported here are computed over 100 trials.\n\nPlease let us know for any additional questions. Thanks!"

                "content": "Thank you very much for your constructive and thoughtful comments,  and we would like to address your concerns as follows:\n\n1. Ablation study on the effect of the metric loss.\n\nWe have revised the paper and shown in Appendix B that the simulation performance is comparable with or without a metric loss. However, including metric loss effectively preserves the distance of the original state in the embedding space, which is a desirable character for control synthesis.\n\nOur objective function for control is defined in the embedding space (please see Section 3.4). The derived control signals aim at minimizing the L2 distance to the target embedding. Only when the distance is better preserved can minimizing the distance in the embedding space effectively minimizes the distance between states.\n\nIn the newly added Figure 5(c), we show the control results in the Rope environment, which demonstrates that the model trained with metric loss has a better performance.\n\n2. The correctness of the reimplementation of the baselines.\n\nOur setting is different from the settings in the original IN and PN papers since we do not assume we know the physical parameters and their values, e.g., stiffness, mass, gravity, etc. Instead, the parameters are embedded in the transition matrices during the system identification stage (Section 3.3).\n\nTo check the fidelity of our reimplementation of IN/PN, we test our implementation in settings that are similar to the original IN/PN papers where the physical parameters are known. As shown in Appendix B in our revised paper, the simulation errors of our reimplementation are consistent with the errors reported in the original PN paper of around 0.05 at 100 time-steps. IN and PN slightly outperform our method as the internal linear structure limits our model's expressiveness. However, in the real world, we do not always know the physical parameters and their values, which makes our method preferable when adapting to new environments.\n\n3. Observation space.\n\nIn the Rope environment, each mass on the rope is considered as an object. The observation of each mass is its position and velocity, which has a dimension of 4. In total, a rope with N masses has an observation space of dimension 4N.\n\nIn both the Soft and the Swim environments, each quadrilateral is considered as an object. For each quadrilateral, we have access to the positions and velocities of the four corners. Thus for a soft robot containing N quadrilaterals, we have a 4 * 4 * N = 16N dimensional observation.\n\n4. Types of interactions.\n\nIn our experiments, interactions are considered different if the types are different or the objects involved have different physical properties.\n\nIn the Rope environment, the top mass has a fixed height and is considered differently from the other masses. Thus, we have 2 types of object-same-object interactions for the top mass and the non-top masses. In addition, we have 8 object-other-object interactions. The objects on a relation could be either top mass or non-top mass. It is a combination of 4. And the interaction may happen between two nearby masses or two masses that are two-hop away. In total, the number of object-other-object interactions is 4 * 2 = 8.\n\nIn the Soft and the Swim environments, there are three types of quadrilaterals: rigid, soft and actuated. We have three object-same-object interactions correspondingly. For the object-other-object interactions, we add edges between two quadrilaterals only if they are connected by a point or edge. We are using different relation types if the types of the connected objects are different. In total, there are 3 * 3 * 2 = 18 object-other-objects. \n\n5. The connection to linear control theory.\n\nThe original Koopman theory paper did not consider dynamical systems with control. However, the lack of theory does not hamper the practical usage of the Koopman operator in many control tasks. Many previous papers [1, 2] followed the paradigm that adds the control as a linear effect in the latent Koopman space. While the optimality of these controllers has yet to be proved, \u201cthe numerical performance is striking\u201d [1].\n\nThe Koopman theory is developed for the deterministic dynamical system, which is also the focus of this paper. For the stochasticity introduced by the policy, i.e., we are uncertain about the action given the current state, our model can still work as long as the underlying dynamics are deterministic. \n\nWe have revised the paragraph in section 3.1 to include the discussion. \n\nPlease let us know for any additional questions.

A physical system is a represented as a graph; graph neural network is used to encode the current state to an object-centric embedding where the dynamics are assumed to be linear (Koopman operator theory) and modeled as a transition matrix. The key contribution is to recognize that similar physical interactions can be modeled using same parameters which constraints the transition matrix to be block-wise with shared parameters.

The efficiency of the proposed algorithm compared to prior work makes is much practically useful.\n* Well written with examples and illustrative figures.\n* Quantitative analysis together with ablation studies on the structure are insightful.\n\nWeaknesses\n* My primary concern are with the evaluation.\n- Experiments are only conducted on synthetic datasets.

I do appreciate the great value of this work, but I am still worried about the claim of optimality, even though I understand that this optimality is restricted to the model the authors proposed. My understanding is that from the upper bounds in Theorem 1, no matter what optimization trajectories, the upper bound only depends on the total compression errors, and the hard-threshod is optimal for any fixed optimization trajectories as long as the right threshold is chosen, and thus the optimality (please let me know if I misunderstood this). However, Theorem 1 only provides an upper bound, if we are minimizing an upper bound, claiming optimal seems to me kind of strong. I understand this upper bound motivates the hard-threshold compression methods, and the paper presents very solid theoretical and experimental results for this method. However, in terms of communication efficiency, i.e. bits over guaranteed optimization errors, there is no clear theoretical improvements shown, so maybe this can be some future works.

Conducts extensive experiments to demonstrate the benefits of hard-threshold sparsifier, achieving much better performance given the same average compression density (# of used coordinates / # of coordinates of DNN weights).   1. I am trying to understand why the proposed communication-complexity model is new, it seems to me it is an adaptive compression operator allowing different # of coordinates to be sent for each iteration. And the section 4.4 and Lemma 3 seems incorrect to me, since the optimization over B is sequential, the choice of first block will change the second block of A, so I didn\u2019t quite follow why the proposed sparisfier is optimal for this communication-complexity model. \n2. On the confusion of total error minimization. In the paragraph starting from line 44, it seems to the authors are trying to present a new perspective that is not minimizing per iteration compression error but total compression errors, but the last sentence seems to me conveying the message of considering fixed total communication budget, which is exactly what I think other papers have discussed, how to tradeoff optimization error with total communication budgets. So there may be some confusion in this paragraph.\n3. The authors provide upper bounds of optimization errors for the proposed spasifier, in strongly convex, convex, and nonconvex settings respectively. Those upper bounds improve from the results using top-k sparsifier in terms of linear speedup and compressor parameter dependence. \n4. The provided upper bounds, however, seem to me not clearly they are more communication-efficient than the top-k sparsifier, since there is no characterization of the total number of coordinates being used in theory. Ideally, if we set the threshold be very small, most coordinates will be used. In experiments, the authors provide solid results showing that the hard-threshold sparsifier does use less coordinates in total than the top-k. \n5. The total error minimization perspective seems to me more like an observation of the consequence using a hard-threshold sparsifier, it may need further arguments to show it is the reason for better performance. \n6.

                "content": "The paper studies the role of compression operators on the convergence of Distributed SGD with Error Feedback. In particular, via simple observations, the authors conclude that a hard-threshold sparsifier with a carefully tuned threshold parameter minimizes the total error appearing in the analysis because of the presence of compression. Moreover, they show empirically the connection between poor behavior of EF-SGD with Top-k compression and the severe error accumulation.\n\nMotivated by these observations, the authors derive new convergence guarantees for EF-SGD with absolute compressors. This class of compressors covers hard-threshold sparsifier. The derived bounds show that the compression does not affect the slowest terms in the bound. Moreover, the authors derived the first complexity result in the non-convex case for EF-SGD with $\\delta$-cnotraction operators without bounded gradient assumption and $n > 1$ (though, under bounded data dissimilarity). Finally, the paper contains a good empirical study of the performance of EF-SGD with the hard-threshold sparsifier. The authors also provide an insight on how to tune the threshold parameter in order to outperform EF-SGD with the Top-k operator.  ## Strengths\n\n1. **Simple but important observations about total error minimization.** The paper provides a closer look at the convergence of EF-SGD and identifies what quantity should be minimized in order to get better results. That is, via the sequence of simple observations, authors show that a hard-thresholding sparsifier (with fine-tuned threshold parameter) is the optimal choice in terms of the total error minimization. Moreover, the authors properly explain all the details and support their theoretical observations with empirical findings (e.g., see Figures 1 and 3).\n\n2. **Clarity and proofs.** The paper is clearly written. The proofs are easy to follow and contain only a couple of typos.\n\n3. **New results for EF-SGD.** The authors derived new results for the convergence of EF-SGD with absolute compression for strongly convex, convex, and non-convex objectives. The slowest terms in the derived bounds have a linear speedup and are not affected by compression-dependent parameters. This is a good property since the derived bounds match the ones for SGD without compression if the target accuracy is small enough / the number of communication rounds is large enough. Moreover, the authors derived the first convergence result for EF-SGD for $\\delta$-contraction operators without assuming boundedness of the gradients, but under Assumption 4, that bounds dissimilarity between local loss functions. Although the proofs substantially rely on the known techniques, the obtained results are quite good.\n\n4. **Numerical experiments** show a connection between the behavior of EF-SGD with Top-k and hard-thresholding sparsifier and \"error buildup\". Therefore, these numerical results justify the insights provided in Section 4.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n1. **No analysis for the arbitrary heterogeneous case for non-convex objectives (minor).** The derived bounds in the non-convex case substantially rely on Assumption 4 that bounds the dissimilarity between local loss functions. Although this is a significant limitation, previous works on EF-SGD rely on even stronger assumptions. Therefore, this is a minor drawback.\n\n## Questions and Comments\n\n1. **Rates for EF-SGD with $\\delta$-contraction operator.** The rates shown in Remarks 5 and 7 can be significantly improved via the results from [19]. Although, in [19], Assumption 3 is not considered it can be easily cast in the general framework from [19] via the following derivation: $\\frac{M}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\|\\nabla f_i(x^k)\\|^2 + \\sigma^2 \\leq 2LM(f(x^k) - f(x^*)) + \\frac{M}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\|\\nabla f_i(x^*)\\|^2 + \\sigma^2$. Using the results from [19] one can actually show the linear speedup even for $\\delta$-contraction operators in the $\\mathcal{O}(1/T)$ and $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$ decaying terms for $\\mu > 0$ and $\\mu = 0$ respectively. Therefore, the conclusion from lines 270-272 is not correct.\n\n2. **equation after line 654:** the enumerator in the second term should be $\\mu L^2(1+M/n)^2R_0 + L\\kappa^2 \\ln(T)$.\n\n3. **line 247, $\\nu = \\gamma_t \\kappa$:** It is better not to use $\\kappa$ in the definition of $\\nu$ because $\\kappa$ usually denotes the condition number of the problem in the optimization literature.\n\n4. **lines 283-284:** This is done for $\\delta$-contraction operators in [19] and in Qian, X., Dong, H., Richt\u00e1rik, P., & Zhang, T. Error Compensated Loopless SVRG for Distributed Optimization, Qian, X., Richt\u00e1rik, P., & Zhang, T. (2020). Error compensated distributed SGD can be accelerated. arXiv preprint arXiv:2010.00091.\n\n5. **Lemmas 6 and 7.** First of all, one should add that $\\gamma = \\min\\left(\\frac{1}{d}, \\sqrt{\\frac{r_0}{cT}}\\right)$. Next, Lemma 7 can be tightened when $c$ is small, see Lemma D.3 from [19].\n\n6. **Lemma 9.** When $c = 0$ this result is incorrect since the logarithmic factor becomes infinity. See Lemma D.2 from [19] for the correct version.\n\n7. **Lemma 11.** It is better to cite the assumptions of the lemma in the statement (or at the beginning of the subsection).\n\n8. **lines 623-627:** The discussion in these lines should be rewritten after applying the corrections suggested in comment 1. Moreover, one should also say that $\\lambda$ can be large.\n\n## Comment after rebuttal\nI thank the authors for their response. I have read other reviews as well.

                "content": "The paper considers gradient sparsification for learning in distributed setup, and advocates using a hard-threshold sparsifier combined with error-feedback mechanism. The paper shows that such algorithm is _optimal_ in a certain sense, and give several convergence guarantees for the error-feedback algorithms using absolute compressors and relative compressors. The empirical performance of HT and top-k compressors are also compared.  Post-rebuttal: Thank you for the reply. My concerns have been addressed well. Raising the score to 7.\n\n---\n\n__TL;DR.__ I think this paper presents several meaningful theoretical results as a contribution. However, I think some of the paper's claims are being quite oversold.\n\n__Strengths.__ Some of the theoretical results are definitely very cool to have. I believe that the convergence results in Section 5 (Theorems 2--5) is a nice contribution, and would be of interest to the distributed learning society, especially to those who study error-feedback mechanisms. Also, the proof technique going through the perturbed iteration analysis (via Lemma 10) is quite neat. Finally, the manuscript seems to discuss the related work relatively well.\n\n__Claims on optimality.__ I am very worried about the paper's claims about the optimality. The word \"optimal\" is a very bold, and should be used with a great care (in my opinion), as they could be quite misleading without delivering the assumptions and conditions it relies on. For instance, the abstract states that top-k is \"communication-optimal given a per-iteration $k$-element budget.\" But, what exactly does the word \"communication-optimal\" here mean? It is very easy to understand the statement as saying that such algorithm gives the hypothesis with a smallest loss---either in expected or high-probability sense. If I understood correctly, I think the paper is pointing to lemma 2, where authors state that Top-k gives the sparsified version of the error-feedback (or actually any signal) that has the smallest squared distortion from the original gradient signal. This also relies on the assumption that the choice of sparsification does not affect the subsequent gradient signals. This discrepancy gets more significant for the claims on the optimality of hard-threshold methods, where this \"independency assumption\" is critical for the proof. I believe that these ill-specified claims on the (possibly vacuous notions of) optimality should either be toned down to a certain degree to help readers better understand what the paper is contributing. Also, I think presenting the optimality claims in a form of lemmata without proofs is unnatural, no matter how straightforward the proofs are. I recommend either stating the claims in plain words without a formalization, or provide the result-specific assumptions clearly in the lemma statement---so that it is self-contained---and give at least a formal proof.\n\n__Stating the limitations.___ If I understood correctly, such hard-threshold sparsifiers may need a very high communication throughput at some epochs (mostly earlier). However, there are many setups such high peak communication rate is undesirable, due to the limited capacity of the communication channel (but when the delay is crucial). In such cases, having a constant communication rate could be beneficial. I think authors should discuss such scenarios to appropriately deliver the cases where the considered hard-threshold methods are desirable, and the cases they are not (sorry if I missed these parts).\n\n__Clarity: Why error-feedback?__ I am not entirely sure what is the big motivation behind considering the error-feedback mechanisms for this paper. Line 51 says: \"Consequently, we consider sparsification using the error-feedback mechanism, ...\" but I couldn't really locate the part that necessitates considering error-feedback. Could you please further clarify?\n\n__Clarity: $\\gamma_t$.__ The quantity $\\gamma_t$ appears at line 133, but I do not think this quantity is defined or introduced properly in the text.\n\n__Clarity: Assumption 2.__ I do not think Assumption 2 is explicitly assumed in any theorem appearing in the main text. But if I am correct, it is implicitly used for every theorems that use $R_0 := \\lVert x_T - x^\\star \\rVert$ in its bounds.\n\n__Question: $v$-dependency__ It was unexpected to me that the convergence guarantees for the absolute compressors $C_v ( \\cdot ) $ does not depend explicitly on the compression factor $v$, especially considering the fact that the guarantees for the $\\delta$-contraction operators contain a term that is inversely proportional to $\\delta$ (see Theorem 2 & Remark 5, for instance). Any further discussion explaining why such discrepancy happens (especially for the case $\\delta \\to 0, v \\to \\infty$) would be very nice to have; does this suggest the existence of a tighter bound for $\\delta$-contraction operators under additional assumptions the size of $p_{i,t}$?\n\n__Suggestion: Discussing $P_T$.__ While the quantity $P_T$ appears in many optimization literature, the meaning of the quantity may not be very straightforward for the readers who are relatively new to the field (like myself), especially because it gives the performance bound for $\\bar{x}_T$ generated by some weights $w_t$. Giving more ideas about the quantity may help the readers a lot, including whether one can choose $w_t$ arbitrarily or not, whether it implies that we should use an averaging scheme... I think authors should additionally mention when can such variable-communication-load methods may not useful or usable."

                "content": " We sincerely thank the reviewer for the positive assessment of our paper and for constructive feedback. Below we address the points mentioned by the reviewer:\n\n\n**1.Communication-complexity model and total error minimization.** We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We accept that there is a slight misunderstanding about the simplification in our communication-complexity model. As mentioned in line 192, we assume a simplified model---Instead of the error-corrected update, $\\gamma g_t +e_t$, we consider a sequence of *fixed* vectors $(a_t)_{t \\in T}$  and formalized the optimization problems (5) and (6) in Section 4.4. Hence as the reviewer asserted, the optimization in Section 4.4 is not sequential. We will clarify this. \n\nWe note that the existing communication-optimal strategies [18, 38, 13, 4] minimize the compression factor (see Footnote 2) under a budget for each vector; please see lines 221-227. In contrast, the novelty of our communication-complexity model is that it better captures the total error. We owe this insight to Theorem 1 that accounts for the effect of sparsification in the entire training process. Please refer to the statement of Theorem 1, which presents the convergence of distributed error-feedback SGD with compressed communication (here, sparsification). The third term on the right hand side of the inequality captures the effect of compression between the error-corrected update, $\\gamma g_t +e_t$, and its compressed form, $C(\\gamma g_t +e_t)$ over all iterations, $t=0,1,\\cdots, T-1$. This is a well-accepted theoretical result and appears abundantly in the literature; please see [29,46]. Motivated by this result, we consider the total error perspective as a communication complexity model----where simplified total error is minimized under a total communication budget. Hard-threshold sparsifier comes out as the communication-optimal compressor under this communication complexity model. Therefore, the total-error minimization is not the consequence of using the hard-threshold sparsifier; it is the reason behind the hard-threshold as a communication-optimal sparsifier. Moreover, we substantiate this with insights from our experiments in Figures 1, 3, 5, and 6. \n\nNext, we respectfully note that we use the overall communication budget to denote the total communication throughout the training.\n\n\n**2. Convergence of hard-threshold.** We thank the reviewer for this question. The reviewer is correct---Our convergence results do not show that the hard-threshold is more communication-efficient than Top-$k$. Because we do not characterize the average data transmission for a threshold. However, we have demonstrated that hard-threshold is communication-optimal in our communication-complexity model. Our communication-complexity model is motivated by the EF-SGD non-convex convergence result, and it provides us insight into why hard-threshold has better convergence than Top-$k$ in practice."

                "content": " We are grateful to the reviewer for the constructive feedback and for providing a positive assessment of our paper. The reviewer has raised some valid questions and provided many mindful suggestions. The following are our responses to the reviewer\u2019s comments: \n\n**Claims on optimality:** We thank the reviewer for this comment. Our use of the word *optimal* is motivated by recent literature in compressed distributed optimization [ 39, 18, 13, 4] that focus on the compression-error (see Footnote 2). Any compressed optimization convergence analysis captures the effect of compression via the compression-error, and this effect is always inverse---the lower the compression error, the better the optimization upper bound is. Please refer to one-step descent Lemmas 12 and 15. To derive a convergence rate from these lemmas, we need to use the worst-case compression error/factor . For instance, to derive a convergence rate for $\\delta$-contraction operators in Remark 5 and Remark 7, one uses the worst-case compression factor in equation (7) and lines 211-212. Due to this, [39, 18, 13, 4] directly optimize for this worst-case compression factor and call their compressors as *optimal*. \n\nHowever, for gradient sparsification with a fixed $k$ element communication per iteration, this worst-case bound is not insightful. For example, to sparsify a $d$-dimensional vector, both Random-$k$, and Top-$k$ have the same compression factor, $k/d$, although Top-$k$ performs significantly better in practice than Random-$k$; please see further discussion in [8]. But we know that for a given signal, Top-$k$ attains the lowest compression-error among all sparsifiers with $k$ element communication budget. And therefore, we state Top-$k$ as the communication-optimal sparsifier under a fixed $k$-element communication budget. Precisely, this is the message behind Lemma 2 as the reviewer has correctly identified. We will elaborate on this in detail in the final version.\n\nNext, we will mitigate the confusion regarding Lemma 3. We agree that we should provide proof for Lemma 3, and will do so in the Appendix of the revised paper. Please note that we have been careful to stress throughout the text that hard-threshold is communication optimal *in our communication complexity model*, and have stated that the total-error cannot be directly minimized (Lines 175-177). We coined the term *total-error* because this term captures the compression error in the entire training process. We formalize our communication complexity model in (5) after simplifying the total error; please see Lines 191-193. \n\n**Stating the limitations.** We thank the reviewer for pointing this out and we agree with the comment. Indeed there are scenarios where a predetermined compression ratio for an iteration is desirable. Examples include dynamic network environments such as a public cloud or a shared cluster with colocated jobs [Abdelmoniem et al., 2021]. In such a setting, one may want to adjust the compression knobs according to the current network bandwidth so that training finishes within a time budget, and therefore hard-threshold is not a good candidate for this setting. \n\nIn a standard distributed cluster setting with a dedicated network, if communication is a bottleneck for Top-$k$, i.e., there is not a complete overlap between communication and computation, so a hard-threshold with the same total communication volume will have non-overlapped communication in the iterations with high data transmission, but may also have completely overlapped communication in iterations with low data transmission. Thus, hard-threshold can have less non-overlapped communication time than Top-$k$ in this case. This happens in large-scale CRT models such as DeepLight which has 90% of non-overlapping communication. Considering the opposite, if there is complete overlap between computation and communication for Top-$k$, then a hard-threshold with the same total communication volume may have non-overlapped communication time in some iterations with high data transmission. Here, we ignored two important aspects of hard-threshold: (i) Hard-threshold has better statistical efficiency than Top-$k$, thus one may require smaller iterations to a target accuracy. (ii) Hard-threshold has negligible compression overhead in comparison to Top-$k$ (lines 73-79). \n\n[Abdelmoniem et al., 2021] DC2: Delay-aware compression control for distributed machine learning. IEEE INFOCOMM 2021.\n\n**Why error-feedback?** This is a critical question and we thank the reviewer for asking this. Please allow us to discuss the development of the error-feedback theory in this context. Error-feedback was first empirically introduced by Seide et al. [40] in 2014, to alleviate the convergence of 1-bit low-precision SGD in training language models. But, for the next 5 years, the community was unaware about why error-feedback is an important technique. In 2018, Stich et al. [45] were the first to theoretically establish the convergence of SGD using $\\delta$-contraction operators with error-feedback, which was extended to the distributed setting by Zheng et al. in [55]. More interestingly, in subsequent work, Karimireddy et al. [29] theoretically showed that error-feedback can remedy the convergence issues of aggressive quantizers, such as 1-bit/Sign SGD, as well as biased $\\delta$-sparsifiers, such as Top-$k$, Random-$k$, etc. We also refer to [46] for a detailed discussion on the error-feedback framework. In a nutshell, without error-feedback, most sparsifiers (which also belong to the class of $\\delta$-contraction operators) diverge [29,46]. Moreover, the best compression ratios for gradient sparsification are achieved when we use error-feedback. Please refer to Table 1 in the comprehensive survey [54], where all implemented sparsifiers use error-feedback. This makes error-feedback an \"indispensable and essential\" technique for gradient sparsification. And this was the \"big motivation\" of using error-feedback in our work as it is focussed on gradient sparsification. However, we also thank the reviewer for pointing out \"Line 51 says: \"Consequently, we consider sparsification using the error-feedback mechanism, ....\".\" We will rewrite this line to justify why we use the error-feedback. \n\n**Clarity:$\\gamma_t$**. Thank you for this important observation. We will clearly mention that $\\gamma_t>0$ is the stepsize sequence. \n*Assumption 2.* We thank the reviewer for catching this typo and rectifying us. We will mention Assumption 2 in the theorems where it is supposed to appear. \n\n**$\\upsilon$-dependency.** We apologize for the confusion. Absolute compressors\u2019 convergence is in terms of $\\kappa$; please see lines 244-250. We will make this clearer by directly compressing the error-compensated gradients in Algorithm 1 instead of the error-compensated updates as done presently. \n\n**Discussing $P_T$.** The quantity $P_T$ in our paper denotes the expected suboptimality gap, $E[f(\\bar{x}_T)]-f^\\star$ at averaged iterate, $\\bar{x}_T$, where $f^*$ is the global minimum, defined in Assumption 2. We understand and appreciate the reviewer's concern in clarifying the meaning behind this quantity. Here $w_t$ is a carefully chosen set of weights such that we achieve the convergence result. We will highlight its meaning with references at the beginning of Section 5.1 where it appears for the first time. \n"

                "content": "Recently, Vision Transformer and its variants have shown great promise on various computer vision tasks. The ability to capture local and global visual dependencies through self-attention is the key to its success. But it also brings challenges due to quadratic computational overhead, especially for the high-resolution vision tasks(e.g., object detection). Many recent works have attempted to reduce the cost and improve model performance by applying either coarse-grained global attention or fine-grained local attention. However, both approaches cripple the modeling power of the original self-attention mechanism of multi-layer Transformers, leading to sub-optimal solutions.  In this paper, we present focal attention, a new attention mechanism that incorporates both fine-grained local and coarse-grained global interactions.  In this new mechanism, each token attends its closest surrounding tokens at the fine granularity and the tokens far away at a coarse granularity and thus can capture both short- and long-range visual dependencies efficiently and effectively. With focal attention, we propose a new variant of Vision Transformer models, called Focal Transformers, which achieve superior performance over the state-of-the-art (SoTA) Vision Transformers on a range of public image classification and object detection benchmarks.  In particular, our Focal Transformer models with a moderate size of 51.1M and a large size of 89.8M achieve 83.6% and 84.0%Top-1 accuracy, respectively, on ImageNet classification at 224\u00d7224.  When employed as the backbones, Focal Transformers achieve consistent and substantial improvements over the current SoTA Swin Transformers [44] across 6 different object detection methods.  Our largest Focal Transformer yields58.7/59.0boxmAPs and50.9/51.3mask mAPs on COCO mini-val/test-dev, and55.4mIoU onADE20K for semantic segmentation, creating new SoTA on three of the most challenging computer vision tasks. \n"

                "content": "This paper proposes a focal version of self-attention module for vision transformers. The query is kept at high resolution, but the number of keys is reduced depending on the relative position difference. This proposed attention is implemented within multi-scale windows. It shows good performance on top of recent transformer advances, on ImageNet and COCO.\n  ## Strength\n1. The proposed focal attention mechanism is original and novel.\n2. The idea is clearly presented with equations and illustrations.\n3. Training details included for fair comparison and reproducing. Comparison is fair with other methods.\n4. Various settings and tasks are explored and compared with solid baselines.\n\n## Weakness\n1. Runtime / throughput is not clear. The proposed attention requires extra subsampling layers, key value computation, and more importantly, concatenating keys and values from different resolution windows (according to the code). These might introduce extra runtime cost with the same FLOPs. But this is not sufficiently discussed in the paper.\n2. Scaling to larger models. The ImageNet performance of Focal-Base is the same as Focal-Small, and is similar to Swin with the same size. In addition, the improvement over Swin in the Small regime is limited as well. In this case, error bars may be reported to address result variances. However, Focal-Base improves consistently on detection segmentation tasks, given a limited ImageNet Top-1. Does it suggest that more context (larger focal size) is necessary for COCO than ImageNet? (Relates to the discussion in Line 281).\n3. What is the intuition behind sharing the same set of query key parameter for both small and large windows? It does save parameters and FLOPs, but the model might be extracting local edges/corners with fine detail and global semantic concepts with coarse context windows. This seems to suggest that different (not shared) parameters might be good for fine and coarse levels. It might be worth ablating that three independent attention could be used for the three levels.\n4. The training recipe seems modified slightly from DeiT/Swin, e.g. the drop path rate. Does it affect comparison fairness?\n\n------------------------------------------------------------Post Rebuttal-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter reading the author rebuttal and other reviews, I think the weakness 2 and 4 are mostly addressed. Nevertheless, the runtime/throughput is a confirmed weakness according to the authors' results in the rebuttal and is also a shared concern among reviewers. But I think this is ok given other contribution of the paper. In this case, I keep my original rating of 6. Yes."

                "title": "One more experimental result on number of focal levels",
                "content": " We thank the reviewer again for the great suggestion of comparing two focal levels and three focal levels.\n\nIn our previous response, we had reported the comparison between two and three focal levels with window size=7. We did not observe noticeable improvement when adding the second focal level into our current Focal-Tiny model. We suspect one of the two reasons is that the odd window size 7 makes it hard to align the pooled window tokens at the second level to a window. Hence, we change it to an even number 8. Note that changing window size to 8 can ensure the correct alignment but requires padding the feature map at each layer so that it can be divided by 8. Below we report the performance for our Focal-Tiny models using two and three focal levels with window size=8.\n\n| Model | window size | focal levels | Top-1 Acc. | #params. | GFLOPs | Throughput (imgs/s) |\n| --- | --- |  --- | --- |  --- | --- | --- |\n| Focal-Tiny | 8 | 2 | 82.16 | 29.20 | 4.99 | 282 |\n| Focal-Tiny | 8 | 3 | 82.26 | 29.22 | 5.03 | 226 |\n||\n\nAccording to the above table, adding the second focal level does bring minor improvement to the original Focal-Tiny model. But still, the improvement is minor with respect to the extra overhead in terms of throughput. Along with our previous results, we can conclude that adding a second focal level can only bring minor improvement because the region is already covered by focal level 1 and 3 regarding the receptive field. Hence, we believe the gain brought by our proposed focal self-attention is mainly attributed to its ability to model both short- and long-term interactions across different visual tokens, rather than the pyramid of the feature map. As a result, we recommend using two focal levels as in our current Focal Transformers. "

Based on this result, we agree with the reviewer that using different qkv embedding layers should be better to capture the different granularities of visual contents, but at the cost of extra model parameters. We will add this experiment to our revision."

We are also encouraged that Reviewer rkny and B1T8 think our method is original and novel, and Reviewer HEkP thinks our design is reasonable to address an interesting research problem as acknowledged by Reviewer NEKg. \n\nBased on all the constructive comments, we can summarize two common concerns about our work. Our separate responses to these two concerns raised by different reviewers may be slightly different based on the specific questions, but here we attempt to address the common pieces at the beginning to help align the discussion. \n\n### 1. Concern about model efficiency/throughput\n\nWe thank the reviewers for raising this concern and suggesting us to report the throughputs. Indeed we found FLOPs cannot directly reflect the running speed of different methods. Below we report the throughputs for different methods, including Vision Transformer (ViT), DeiT, PvT, CvT, Vision-Longformer (ViL), Swin Transformers, and our own Focal Transformers. For comprehensiveness, we not only compare the throughputs with the conventional input resolution 224x224 for image classification but also compare on higher input resolutions 448x448 and 896x896 as suggested by Reviewer HEkP. We report the numbers below. \n\n| Model | Top-1 Acc | GFLOPs | 224x224 | 448x448 | 896x896 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\nDeiT-Small/16 | 79.8 | 4.6 | 939 | 101 | 20\nPVT-Small | 79.8 | 3.8 | 794 | 172 | 31\nCvT-13 | 81.6 | 4.5 | 746 | 125 | 14 \nViL-Small | 82.0 | 5.1 | 397 | 87 | 17\nSwin-Tiny | 81.2 | 4.5 | 760 | 189 | 48\nFocal-Tiny | 82.2 | 4.9 | 319 | 105 | 27\n||\nPVT-Medium | 81.2 | 6.7 | 517 | 111 | 20\nCvT-21 | 82.5 | 7.1 | 480 | 85 | 10\nViL-Medium | 83.3 | 9.1 | 251 | 53 | 8 \nSwin-Small | 83.1 | 8.7 | 435 | 111 | 28\nFocal-Small | 83.5 | 9.1 | 192 | 63 | 17\n| |\nViT-Base/16 | 77.9 | 17.6 | 291 | 57 | 8\nDeit-Base/16 | 81.8 | 17.6 | 291 | 57 | 8 \nPVT-Large | 81.7 | 9.8 | 352 | 77 | 14\nViL-Base | 83.2 | 13.4 | 145 | 35 | 5\nSwin-Base | 83.4 | 15.4 | 291 | 70 | 17\nFocal-Base | 83.8 | 16.0 | 138 | 44 | 11\n| |\n\nIn the above table, we notice that Focal Transformers are slower than most of their counterparts except for ViL on low-resolution inputs. When the resolution increases, our models become more comparable and even faster than several methods. Particularly, we notice that ViT/DeiT, CvT and ViL become less efficient for high-resolution inputs. We suspect it is because ViT/DeiT performs fined-grained global self-attention, CvT performs convolution, and then the global self-attention across the whole feature map. Though ViL performs local self-attention, it has several global tokens which attend to the whole feature map. In contrast, our Focal Transformer models are more flexible to different input resolutions, since it performs window-wise attention and has predetermined focal region size and focal window size that are independent of the input resolution. Likewise, Swin Transformers also have such property and thus can maintain very good efficiency for higher resolution input. Giving the above table, we refer the reviewers to our separate responses for a more detailed analysis. We will add all these comparisons and analyses into our revision. Above all, we would like to highlight here that the main motivation for us to propose the focal self-attention to model both short- and long-range interactions is that we would like to apply it to high-resolution inputs which are required for various dense prediction tasks, such as object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. \n\n### 2. Concern about Focal-Base model\n\nAnother main concern about our method is the seemingly saturated performance of our Focal-Base model. We also observed this when submitting our paper. Based on our follow-up experiments, we found this is not because our Focal Transformers is prone to overfit when the model becomes larger. Instead, it is mainly because of the sub-optimal hyperparameter setting, i.e., the drop path rates. Following Swin Transformer, when we changed the drop path rate 0.3 to 0.5 for our Focal-Base model, we obtained maximally 83.8% (83.7% on average over multiple runs) top-1 accuracy, which has a substantial margin to Swin-Base model. When we further increase the focal region size from [7,5,3,1] to [9,7,5,1] to capture more long-range dependencies for our Focal-Base model, we observed further improvement to 83.9% top-1 accuracy on average. These experiments clearly address the concerns raised by the reviewers.\n\n### 3. Implementation details\n\nBesides the above two main common concerns, some reviewers are confused by the implementation details of our Focal Transformer model. To resolve these concerns, we had replied separately and explained the computation process we used to implement the focal self-attention. More importantly, we will release the full code so that others can reproduce the results reported in our submission and here."

We refer the reviewer to our response to Reviewer HEkP above for more comparisons on higher resolution inputs. Based on our investigations on different ablated models, we found the throughput decrease is because of two reasons: 1) the overhead to extract the fine-grain and coarse-grain tokens at each transformer layer; 2) the extra computation after adding more keys and values. By measuring the speed for each of the ablated Focal-Tiny models in Figure 5 of our main submission, we obtain the numbers in the below table. We further factorize the time cost of key and value extraction and attention computation by implementing pseudo versions of Focal-Tiny-local and Focal-TIny-global which retain the same number of keys and values by appending pseudo tokens instead of extracting them from the (pooled) feature map. As we can see, local fine-grained local attention leads to more computational cost than coarse-grained global attention. By comparing them with the corresponding pseudo versions, we can see that extracting fine-grained local tokens and coarse-grained global tokens both introduce more overheads than the attention computation. Moreover, extracting fine-grained tokens is relatively heavier than extract coarse-grained tokens.\n\n| Model                                    | Top-1 Acc | GFLOPs   | Throughput (imgs/s) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\nFocal-Tiny                             | 82.2           | 4.92         | 319 \nFocal-Tiny-local                    | 81.4           | 4.90         | 417 \nFocal-Tiny-local-pseudo     | n/a             | 4.90         | 636 \nFocal-Tiny-global                 | 81.6            | 4.59        | 516 \nFocal-Tiny-global-pseudo   | n/a             | 4.59         | 633 \nFocal-Tiny-window              | 80.1            | 4.49        | 731  \n\nBased on the above comparisons, we notice the fine-grained local attention brings most of the extra time cost, and it is mainly due to the sub-optimal implementation of extracting surrounding fine-grained key and value tokens for each window. Currently, we implement this using rolling operations, which is two times faster than the conventional unfolding operation. However, we find this customized implementation is still under-optimized compared with a cuda kernel as used in the convolution layer, especially for the earlier stage which has relatively higher feature resolution. We believe when an efficient cuda kernel implementation is available, this extra time cost can be reduced significantly to approach the gap of FLOPs between different methods. Before that, we empirically studied how our models perform when removing a few time-consuming fine-grained local attentions. Specifically, we tried two variants, one is removing the fine-grained local attention at the first stage, the other one is removing local attention at all odd layers.  As we can see from the table below, these two variants have higher throughputs and slightly lower Top-1 accuracy, but still higher than the Swin-Transformer counterparts. These results imply that we may not need to have fine-grain local attention at all layers and all stages. We will have more systematic studies on this aspect.  \n\n| Model                                                                      | Top-1 Acc | GFLOPs | Throughput (imgs/s)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\nFocal-Tiny                                                               |     82.2       | 4.92        |  319 \nFocal-Tiny (no local fine-grain at first stage)    |     82.1       | 4.77        | 388 \nFocal-Tiny (local fine-grain at even layers)       |     81.9      | 4.75         | 399 \n||\nFocal-Small                                                               |    83.5       |  9.12       | 192 \nFocal-Small (no local fine-grain at first stage)    |   83.5       |  8.98      | 217 \nFocal-Small (local fine-grain at even layers)       |   83.3       |  8.85      | 240 \n||\nFocal-Base                                                          |    83.8       | 16.04    | 138  \nFocal-Base (no local fine-grain at first stage)     |    83.7       | 15.80   | 154 \nFocal-Base (local fine-grain at even layers)        |    83.5       |  15.56  | 172 \n\n**Q3. Comparing three focal levels with two focal levels used in the paper.**\n\nA3: Thanks for raising this question! The reason why we chose to use two focal levels in all our experiments is that we observed introducing the extra focal level 2 can slightly improve the performance in some cases but brings extra computational overheads in the meantime. Below we assume the finest level as focal level 1 and the coarsest level as focal level 3 and study whether adding the middle focal level can help improve the performance.\n\n| Model |  | focal level 1 | focal level 2 | focal level 3 | Top-1 acc | \\#Params. | GFLOPs | Throughputs |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | \nFocal-Tiny | | - | - | yes      | 81.6   | 28.7 | 4.59  | 516 \nFocal-Tiny | | - | yes | yes | 81.8   | 28.7 | 4.61   | 388\nFocal-Tiny | | yes | - | yes |  82.2 | 29.1 | 4.91 |  319\nFocal-Tiny | | yes | yes | yes | 82.2 | 29.2 | 4.93 | 269\n\nAs we can see from the table, when focal level 1 is missed, adding focal level 2 can improve the performance by 0.2% with the Focal-Tiny model. However, when we use focal level 1, adding focal level 2 cannot further have sensible improvement. We suspect there may be two reasons. First, as we mentioned in lines 159-161, we did not exclude the overlapped tokens across different focal levels. This means that the pooled window tokens at focal level 2 actually have a lot of overlaps to focal levels 1 and 3. This redundancy may explain why adding focal level 2 can improve the performance when merely using focal 3 but not for the combination of focal levels 1 and 3. Second, as we mentioned in our submission, we used the same window size=7 for a fair comparison with Swin Transformers. However, this odd window size hinders us to get a good alignment between each 7x7 window and the sub-windows at focal level 2 (because we need to halve the window size for pooling). We need to perform either padding or trimming for the original feature map so that the number of pooled windows at focal level 2 exactly matches the required one for each window-wise focal attention. We think this misalignment may introduce some noises to the focal self-attention which dismisses the potential benefits. For comprehensiveness, we will add this ablation study in our revision. Moreover, to verify our assumption, we will study whether focal level 2 can bring us some improvements when the windows are well-aligned for focal self-attention, e.g. we change the window size from 7 to 8. We will post the results during the discussion when the experiments are completed.\n\n**Q4: Confusion about handling size mismatch in focal attention computation.**\n\nA4: Thanks for raising this confusion! Given the feature map at a certain stage, e.g., 28x28 at the second stage, we first perform window pooling with s^l_{w}=7 to get 4x4 feature map as described at lines 142-149, then we use unfold operation with (filter_size=5, stride=1, padding=2) to perform the unfolding to get 5x5=25 window tokens for each of these 4x4=16 windows. As such, each of 7x7=49 tokens in a window shares the surrounding 25 window tokens when performing self-attention. Note that we always mask out the padding tokens during unfolding for precise self-attention computations. This strategy is used across all layers and all stages in our Focal Transformers, and the padding size is set to s^l_{r} //2 to adapt to different focal region sizes at different stages.\n\n\n"

Below we report the throughputs for our Focal Transformers with different model sizes.

We also add the Top-1 accuracy and corresponding GFLOPs. Moreover, we measure the throughputs for higher input image resolutions 448x448 and 896x896 to simulate the object detection scenario. Note that we intend to **not** measure the full object detection models because all models share the same FPN/RPN/ROI head, which will discount the differences among different models.  \n\n| Model               | Top-1 Acc | GFLOPs |    224x224  | 448x448 | 896x896  |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------| -------| -------|\nDeiT-Small/16 |      79.8       |  4.6     | 939            |  101          | 20\nPVT-Small        |      79.8       | 3.8      | 794            |  172          | 31 \nCvT-13              |      81.6       | 4.5      | 746            |  125         | 14 \nViL-Small          |      82.0       | 5.1      | 397            |  87           | 17 \nSwin-Tiny         |     81.2       | 4.5       | 760            |  189         | 48 \nFocal-Tiny        |     82.2       | 4.9       | 319            |   105        | 27 \n||\nPVT-Medium  | 81.2        | 6.7      | 517                | 111          | 20 \nCvT-21             | 82.5        | 7.1      | 480                | 85            | 10 \nViL-Medium    | 83.3        | 9.1      | 251               | 53             | 8 \nSwin-Small      | 83.1        | 8.7      | 435               | 111           | 28 \nFocal-Small     | 83.5        | 9.1      | 192                | 63             | 17 \n||\nViT-Base/16    | 77.9        | 17.6     | 291             |  57          | 8\nDeit-Base/16  | 81.8        | 17.6     | 291             |   57         | 8\nPVT-Large       | 81.7        | 9.8       | 352              | 77            |  14 \nViL-Base          | 83.2        | 13.4     | 145              |  35           |  5 \nSwin-Base       | 83.4        | 15.4     | 291              | 70            |  17 \nFocal-Base      | 83.8        | 16.0     | 138              | 44            |  11 \n\nIn the above table, we do notice that Focal Transformers are slower than most of their counterparts except for ViL on low-resolution inputs. However, when the resolution increases, our models become more comparable and even faster than several methods. Particularly,  we notice that CvT and ViL become less efficient for high-resolution inputs. We suspect it is because CvT performs convolution and then the self-attention across the whole feature map, and ViL has several global tokens which attend to the whole feature map. In contrast, our Focal Transformer models are more flexible to different input resolutions, since it performs window-wise attention and has predetermined focal region size and focal window size that are independent of the input resolution. Likewise, Swin Transformers also have such property and thus can maintain good efficiency for higher resolution input.\n\nWe further study which components in our Focal Transformers mainly cause the lower throughputs. Based on our model design, we suspect this is because of two reasons: 1) the overhead to extract the fine-grain and coarse-grain tokens at each transformer layer; 2) the extra computation after adding more keys and values. To get more understanding, we investigate the time cost for different ablated models. By measuring the speed for each of the ablated Focal-Tiny models in Figure 5 of our main submission, we obtain the numbers in the below table. To further factorize the time cost of key and value extraction and attention computation, we implement pseudo versions of Focal-Tiny-local and Focal-TIny-global which retain the same number of keys and values by appending pseudo tokens instead of extracting them from the (pooled) feature map. As we can see, local fine-grained local attention causes more computational cost than coarse-grained global attention. Moreover, extracting fine-grained local tokens introduces more overheads than extracting the coarse-grain global tokens. This inspires one of our future directions on how to extract the local tokens more efficiently.\n\n| Model                                    | Top-1 Acc | GFLOPs   | Throughput (imgs/s) |\n|---|---|---|---|\nFocal-Tiny                             | 82.2           | 4.92         | 319 \nFocal-Tiny-local                    | 81.4           | 4.90         | 417 \nFocal-Tiny-local-pseudo     | n/a             | 4.90         | 636 \nFocal-Tiny-global                 | 81.6            | 4.59        | 516 \nFocal-Tiny-global-pseudo   | n/a             | 4.59         | 633 \nFocal-Tiny-window              | 80.1            | 4.49        | 731  \n\nBased on the above comparisons, we notice the fine-grained local attention brings most of the extra time cost, and it is mainly due to the sub-optimal implementation of extracting surrounding fine-grained key and value tokens for each window. Currently, we implement this using rolling operations, which is two times faster than the conventional unfolding operation. However, we find this customized implementation is still under-optimized compared with an efficient cuda kernel as used in the convolution layer, especially for the earlier stage which has relatively higher feature resolution. We believe when an efficient cuda kernel implementation is available, the efficiency gap can be closed to the gap of FLOPs between different methods. Before that, we empirically studied how our models perform when removing a few time-consuming fine-grained local attentions. Specifically, we tried two variants, one is removing the fine-grained local attention at the first stage, the other one is removing local attention at all odd layers.  As we can see from the table below, these two variants have higher throughputs and slightly lower Top-1 accuracy, but still higher than the Swin-Transformer counterparts. These results imply that we may not need to have fine-grain local attention at all layers and all stages. We will have more systematic studies on this aspect.  \n\n| Model                                                                      | Top-1 Acc | GFLOPs | Throughput (imgs/s) |\n|---|---|---|---|\nFocal-Tiny                                                               |     82.2       | 4.92        |  319 \nFocal-Tiny (no local fine-grain at first stage)    |     82.1       | 4.77        | 388 \nFocal-Tiny (local fine-grain at even layers)       |     81.9      | 4.75         | 399 \n||\nFocal-Small                                                               |    83.5       |  9.12       | 192 \nFocal-Small (no local fine-grain at first stage)    |   83.5       |  8.98      | 217 \nFocal-Small (local fine-grain at even layers)       |   83.3       |  8.85      | 240 \n||\nFocal-Base                                                            |    83.8       | 16.04    | 138  \nFocal-Base (no local fine-grain at first stage)     |    83.7       | 15.80   | 154 \nFocal-Base (local fine-grain at even layers)        |    83.5       |  15.56  | 172 \n\n**Q2. Performance saturates for Focal-Base model.**\n\nA2: Thanks for pointing this out! During our submission, we also observed these close Top-1 accuracies for our Focal-Small and Focal-Base model. Based on our further experiments, we found this is due to the sub-optimal hyperparameter setting. More specifically, in our submission, we set the drop path rate 0.3 for our base model without heavy hyperparameter tuning. But when we increased it to 0.5 following Swin Transformer, we can get a maximal 83.8% (83.7% on average) Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K. This suggests that when vision transformer models become larger and deeper, the drop path rate should also be increased accordingly for a good regularization.\n\nBased on the new drop path rate, we study whether we can further improve the performance of our Focal-Base model. One change we did is that we increase the focal region size from the original [7,5,3,1] to [9,7,3,1], which enables more global interactions at the first two stages. This change achieves a better average Top-1 accuracy 83.9%. When we further change the convolutional patch embedding layer from default non-overlapped (kernel size = stride size) to overlapped ones (kernel size > stride size), the performance can be further improved to 84.1% top-1 accuracy on average. \n\nAll these ablation studies demonstrate that our Focal-Base model is not saturated when we use reasonable hyperparameters and can be further improved from various aspects."

This suggests that when vision transformer models become larger and deeper, the drop path rate should also be increased accordingly for a good regularization to prevent overfitting.  \n\nFor consistency to Swin models, we change the drop path rates for our Focal-Small and Focal-Base to 0.3 and 0.5, respectively, and conduct multiple rounds of training with all our three models as the reviewer suggested. We report the mean Top-1 acc and std below. \n\n\n| Model              |   Top-1 Mean  | Top-1 Std  |\n| -----------           | ----------- | ----------- | \nFocal-Tiny       |    82.15             |  0.105 \nFocal-Small     |    83.51             |  0.055 \nFocal-Base      |    83.69             | 0.1002 \n\nClearly, with the same hyperparameter settings, our Focal-Base has better performance than Focal-Small, and these three models consistently outperform the corresponding Swin Transformers.  \n\nAs the reviewer pointed out, our models indeed have more gains over Swin Transformers on COCO object detection than ImageNet classification when the model becomes larger and deeper. We suspect the reason why we observe this trend is because larger Swin Transformer models can already capture sufficient context through the window-shift mechanism for image classification. Consider the input resolution 224x224. From the first stage to the last stage, the feature map resolutions are 56x56, 28x28, 14x14, and 7x7, respectively. At the earlier stage, our Focal Transformers can capture more long-range dependencies than Swin Transformers. But when it comes to the later stages, the stacked window-shift operation in Swin Transformers can (almost) have a receptive field that covers the whole feature map, especially for larger models. However, for object detection, the input image resolution is usually much higher, e.g., 800x1333. In this case, the feature map at the last stage is still much larger than a window size 7x7. Even the base Swin Transformer is still difficult to capture the global context sufficiently. In contrast, our focal self-attention is intentionally designed to model such long-range dependencies for high-resolution feature maps. As such, we can still observe considerable improvements over Swin Transformers on COCO detection. \n\n**Q3: Intuition behind sharing qkv embedding layer for different focal levels.**\n\nA3: Thanks for this valuable suggestion! The reason for us to share the qkv embedding is two-fold: 1) though the tokens are from different granularities, we would like to project them into the same qkv space so that the attention between queries and keys from different granularities can be well-calibrated; 2) Indeed, using different qkv embedding layers will introduce more parameters. For example, using two qkv embedding layers for the local and global focal levels in our Focal-Tiny models will bring extra ~7M parameters on the original 29M model. We agree with the reviewer that different granularities may need different qkv embedding layers because they may capture different levels of structures. Due to the limited computational resource and time, we cannot report the performance for this new design right now, but we will post the results here once we get the experiments finished. \n\n**Q4: Slight difference on training recipe.**\n\nA4: Thanks for pointing this out! In our submission, we used drop path rates 0.2, 0.2, and 0.3 for our tiny, small, and base Focal Transformers, respectively. In contrast, Swin Transformers used 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5 drop path rates. We observed these differences indeed affect the performance to some extent. As shown in the above table, we reported the numbers with these new settings. Clearly, it helps us to achieve even better performance than our previous setting, especially for our Focal-Base model (83.5->83.8 maximally). Note that even with the sub-optimal hyperparameter setting, our Focal Transformers already outperform Swin Transformers on both image classification and object detection tasks.\n"

We answer the questions one by one below.\n\n**Q1: Dimension inconsistency for convolutional patch embedding layer.**\n\nA1: Sorry for the confusion! By filter size equal to 4, we meant the kernel size for our convolution is set to 4x4. That being said, the convolutional layer we used for the first patch embedding is implemented with pytorch nn.Conv(in_channel=3, out_channel=d, kernel_size=4, stride=4). As such, the input image of size 3x224x224 will be transformed to dx56x56. Note that this convolutional layer is exactly the same as in Swin Transformer for a fair comparison. \n\n**Q2: Big model does not achieve better performance.**\n\nA2: Thanks for pointing this out! We also noticed this when working on our submission. Based on further experiments, we found this is due to the limited hyperparameter tuning, instead of the strong inductive bias or poor generalization ability of big models. More specifically, in our submission, we used a small drop path rate of 0.3 for our Focal-Base model. When we follow Swin Transformer to increase it to 0.5, we can get 83.8% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K. This indicates that when vision transformer models become larger, the drop path rate should also be increased accordingly for a good regularization on the big models.\n\n**Q3: Criterion to put CvT-21 in Table 2.**\n\nA3: Thanks for the suggestion! Though CvT-21 just has a slightly larger model size than our Focal-Tiny (32.0M v.s. 29.1M), we compare it with our Focal-Small for two reasons: 1) it has much higher FLOPs than Focal-Tiny (7.1 GFLOPs v.s. 4.9 GFLOPs), which means more computations are used in the model; 2) it has 21 transformer layers, which is comparable to 24 layers in Focal-Small but much more than 12 layers in Focal-Tiny. Admittedly, the comparison between CvT-21 and Focal-small is still not fair enough. To have a relatively fair comparison, we increase the depth of our Focal-Tiny model from 2-2-6-2 to 1-2-21-1 but decrease the hidden dimension from 96 to 64. These changes lead to a new version of Focal-Tiny model with 26.5M parameters and 4.67 GFLOPs. Based on this new Focal-Tiny model, we achieved 82.9% Top-1 accuracy, which is higher than 82.5 for CvT-21 but uses much fewer parameters and FLOPs. In our revision, we will carefully make fair comparisons with previous works including CvT by adding more variants of our Focal Transformer models to match the number of parameters and GFLOPs as possible as we can.

Although past work has shown empirically that there often exists a coreset with low inferential error, efficiently constructing such a coreset remains a challenge.  Current methods tend to be slow, require a secondary inference step after coreset construction, and do not provide bounds on the data marginal evidence.  In this work, we introduce a new method---sparse Hamiltonian flows---that addresses all three of these challenges.  The method involves first subsampling the data uniformly, and then optimizing a Hamiltonian flow parametrized by coreset weights and including periodic momentum quasi-refreshment steps.  Theoretical results show that the method enables an exponential compression of the dataset in a representative model, and that the quasi-refreshment steps reduce the KL divergence to the target.  Real and synthetic experiments demonstrate that sparse Hamiltonian flows provide accurate posterior approximations with significantly reduced runtime compared with competing dynamical-system-based inference methods."

Generic flows are constructed of black-box parametrized transformations---the flow structure itself does not use information from the target. In contrast, our sparse Hamiltonian flow directly incorporates the coreset target information (see line 156, eq. 5). This allows us to train the coreset weights.\n\nGeneric normalizing flows also do not generally provide error guarantees (in the sense of \"longer flow provides a lower KL\"). There is some past work on analyzing how expressive these families are, but these results are usually abstract universal approximation results (see, e.g., Theorem 3.1, \"The Expressive Power of a Class of Normalizing Flow Models\", 2020). \n\nIt is certainly possible for a generic normalizing flow to outperform our method on a given problem; but without guarantees, it's hard to say much in advance!

I just have one more question:\n\n> Indeed the relative covariance error seems slow to converge, but this is not the complete picture. We need to look at the relative covariance error plot together with the relative mean error plot (Fig. 2c) and the KL plot (Fig. 2b). In particular, the relative mean and covariance error plots depict two different aspects of the quality of our target approximation; the KL plot takes both of these into consideration. For this particular problem, our method finds the center of the target before fine tuning the covariance. The monotonic downward trend of the KL divergence shows that our method keeps on improving the target approximation throughout optimization.\n\n> To understand why the relative mean error and KL divergence go up for UHA, it is important to note that UHA operates on the augmented space based on a sequence of distributions that bridge some simple initial distribution and the target distribution. Therefore, it is not guaranteed that all steps of optimization improve the quality of approximation on the marginal space of the latent variables of interest. This explains the increase in the error metrics on the \\theta-marginal space shown in Figs. 2b and 2c. However, we note that from Fig 2a, UHA\u2019s augmented ELBO as the optimization objective that we maximize over shows a monotonic increasing trend.\n\nRegarding this, in addition to looking at the relative mean and cov separately, perhaps it would be clearer if you plotted the energy distance or MMD?"

Don\u2019t hesitate to follow up with any questions; we are happy to answer them.\n\n> To my understanding, SHF makes some assumptions that imply limitations. For example, SHF chooses a random subset of data points. In cases where a random subset of data points is not representative of the entire dataset, SHF might be fast but not useful. Is this correct? I expect that more complicated data types will run into problems with random subsets more easily. Thus SHF might not be an appropriate solution for more complex models and data.\n\nYou are totally correct; there is usually some probability that the subsample we draw will be totally unrepresentative of the full dataset, at which point the coreset construction is flawed from the start. However, our result in Proposition 3.1 provides guidance on how large one should choose the coreset to be to avoid this problem from occurring. In particular, as long as the coreset size M is roughly d \\log(N), where N is the dataset size and d is the \u201cdimension of the log-likelihood function space,\u201d the probability of randomly obtaining a bad subsample is quite small, as it decays at roughly a N^(-d/2) rate.\n\nNow, as you say, the data might be quite complex\u2014in the notation of our paper, this is when that dimension \u201cd\u201d is quite large for the model under consideration. For example, if the data are very high-dimensional (and do not lie on a low-dimensional manifold), the value of \u201cd\u201d may be quite large. In these cases, we may need to use a rather large coreset, and the approach may not be so useful. \n\nWe will add a discussion of this limitation (and others) in the final camera-ready version.\n\n> Is the subset of M values chosen uniformly at random once at the beginning of the process or does the subset change over time?\n\nThe subset of M uniformly subsampled data points is selected once at the beginning and fixed. However, we do update the weights associated with these data points as we run the variational optimization. \n\n> from steps 0-9 the ELBO decreases rather than increases. I don\u2019t understand why that is the case. My naive assumption would be that the blue lines should also go up just not as drastically as the red lines.\n\nThanks for pointing this out \u2013 great observation! Actually, in theory, the ELBO should stay constant during the simulation of Hamiltonian dynamics if the simulation is perfect (see equation after line 114). However, since SHF uses the gradient of the coreset posterior rather than the full posterior to simulate the dynamics, some error will be introduced. Another source of error comes from the fact that we can only approximately simulate Hamiltonian dynamics using leapfrog steps. Both sources of error can cause the ELBO to change between quasi-refreshment steps. This error could either result in an increase (steps 30-39) or decrease (steps 0 to 9) in the ELBO.\n\n> The limitations of the method were discussed insufficiently and should be addressed.\n\nWe will add some text discussing the limitations of our method for the camera-ready version. In fact, one of the limitations of our method has already been touched upon in the response to your comments above. Specifically, our method relies on the assumption that the data are compressible.\n"

But we recognize that this may have been implied, and will carefully re-word the text for the camera-ready. Finally, note that we see from Fig 5 that our method outperforms other competing methods under models with non-Gaussian posteriors.\n\n> Why was there a difference in the baseline methods included in Fig 2/3 and Fig 4?\n\nThis work builds upon two lines of literature: coreset construction methods, and Hamiltonian-based VI methods. Each of these plots shows a comparison with methods from each line of past work. Figs. 2-3 compare the sample quality, density evaluation time and sample generation time across the posterior approximations produced by various Hamiltonian-based VI methods. Fig. 4 then compares the quality of the posteriors approximated using the coreset obtained from SHF against other coreset construction methods.\n\nFor Figure 2-3 specifically, it is worth noting that all previous Hamiltonian VI methods do not work with a Bayesian coreset; hence they are often quite slow in the regime of large-scale data. In contrast, SHF incorporates coreset Hamiltonian dynamics, leading to fast training, density evaluation, and i.i.d. sampling.\n\nFor Figure 4 specifically, it is worth noting that all previous coreset construction methods do not enable i.i.d. sampling: one needs to use a subsequent inference method on the coreset posterior after construction. In contrast, SHF does enable i.i.d. sampling and density evaluation with no additional secondary stage.\n\n> I would have liked to see simpler Bayesian Inference baselines such as Laplace and simple mean-field VI included as baselines as well.\n\nThank you for the suggestion. We have added a comparison between our method and Laplace approximation using the same Bayesian linear regression model (Section 4.2) in the supplement in Appendix F. Fig. 8 shows that our method provides a higher quality posterior approximation than the Laplace approximation. Specifically, the approximated KL is around 100 for our method, and around 500 for the Laplace approximation. In general, since Laplace and mean-field VI both use Gaussian distributions to approximate the posterior, we anticipate that these simpler baselines will suffer when the posterior is non-Gaussian.\n\n\n> The paper could be further improved with some reflection on the limitations of the approach.\n\nWe agree that there was not enough attention devoted to this in the current version, and will include a discussion in the camera-ready version. One main limitation of this methodology is that we assume that the data are \"compressible\" in the sense that log-likelihood functions of a subset can be used to represent the full log-likelihood (see our response to comments by Reviewer hoPP). If the data are truly very high-dimensional (i.e. not on some low-dimensional manifold), this may not be the case. Another limitation is that while our quasi-refreshment is simple and works well in practice, more work is required to develop quasi-refreshment methods with general guarantees.\n\n> \"...interleaving MCMC and gradient descent steps... \" This sentence was not entirely clear to me.\n\nWe agree that this could be stated more clearly. The idea is: at each iteration of the optimization, MCMC samples for the current coreset posterior are used to estimate the coreset weight gradient. Since the coreset size (M) is much smaller than that of the full dataset (N), MCMC is not expensive. However, the quality of the MCMC samples may be poor without tuning. And it is not realistic to tune the MCMC sampler at each iteration. We will reword this sentence to make it clearer.\n\n> \"Let C be the universal constant\" ...appears a bit unmotivated here \n\nThe constant C here provides an upper bound on the number of spherical balls needed to cover a d-dimensional unit sphere. It is a technical detail that is not of significant importance. We will revise the paper to provide some more context on this constant.\n\n> \"since w only has the first M entries nonzero\" Was the convention of placing the nonzero elements first mentioned anywhere? \n\nWe mentioned this in line 141; this assumption is merely for notational convenience. We will find a way to make it more prominent in the text!\n"

Don\u2019t hesitate to follow up with any questions; we are happy to answer them.\n\n> ...the authors should provide a dedicated Related Work section to elaborate on the connections to earlier work.\n\nYou are correct that the combination of Hamiltonian-based flow with quasi-refreshment and Bayesian coresets is unique to our work. We can certainly add a dedicated related work section that draws connections to earlier work for the camera-ready version. \n\n> ...explain what the advantages of using a Hamiltonian flow are compared to other choices of normalizing flows.\n\nThis is a great suggestion! The intuition here is that Hamiltonian flow methods involve a sequence of transformations that resemble the steps of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). In HMC, we run Hamiltonian dynamics for a while, and then resample the momentum, and repeat; in Hamiltonian flows, we run Hamiltonian dynamics for a while, and then quasi-refresh the momentum, and then repeat. Since we know the Markov chain generated by HMC converges (in distribution) to the target posterior distribution, we expect the Hamiltonian flow to do something similar (although not perfectly, as the quasi-refreshment is not a perfect substitute for exact momentum resampling!).\n\nOne other very important advantage of Hamiltonian flows is that the ODE naturally enables the use of a coreset, which enables us to build a computationally inexpensive flow. By the previous argument, our coreset flow should approximate the coreset posterior reasonably well. Moreover, the optimal coreset should provide a good approximation of the full posterior (for the Gaussian location model this is given by our Proposition 3.1). Therefore, we have constructed a variational family that is both inexpensive to work with and flexible enough to well-approximate the posterior. Standard normalizing flows typically come with no guarantees, and may or may not be expensive to work with depending on design (though more flexible families tend to be more expensive).\n\nWe will add some text outlining these advantages for the camera-ready version. \n\n> ...why this is a representative (or even relevant) example model. Can anything be said about the compression for the posterior of other models? Can anything be said for finite N?\n\nGreat question! By \u201crepresentative,\u201d we mean in terms of how well our result regarding the optimal coreset quality extends. In fact, our proof technique has already been extended to general exponential families (the only difference lies in the choice of sufficient statistic). Unfortunately, this result is in a forthcoming unpublished manuscript which we can\u2019t provide a pointer to quite yet! But if you are willing to take that leap of faith, we note that exponential families can be used to well-approximate a very wide range of models. So we suspect that our result is indicative of a more general setting (at least the fact that the coreset size should scale with some notion of a \u201cdimension\u201d of the model). \n\nRegarding finite N, our proof actually provides a finite-N analysis. See the proof in Appendix C (line 573). However, the finite-N result is somewhat complicated and messy. We chose to present the asymptotic version of the result in the main text due to the simpler final expression.\n\n\n> \"In this work we assume that \\rho_t ~ N(mu, Lambda^-1)\" Does this mean that we are ultimately assuming that the posterior can be approximated by a diagonal Gaussian?  \n\nNo, we do not assume the posterior is a diagonal Gaussian. Let us clarify a bit with two points.\n\n1. The posterior \\pi is set by the likelihood and prior, and is usually not Gaussian. We then augment the posterior with a Gaussian distribution for the momentum. Note that this is not limiting; we are free to pick any \"nice\" distribution for the momentum component. The Gaussian distribution is what people typically use in practice for HMC, and we follow that standard here.\n\n2. The variable \\rho_t is the momentum variable at time t of the Hamiltonian flow. So when we say we assume \\rho_t ~ N(\\mu, \\Lambda^-1), we are making an assumption on the momentum component at time t of our flow. \n\nThe assumption is true for all t if the posterior \\pi is indeed Gaussian. But we actually don\u2019t need this assumption in practical application. The method still works without it, and applies to a wide range of non-Gaussian posteriors. The reason we included this text is because if the assumption holds, the \u201cstandardization\u201d quasi-refreshment in equation (7) is guaranteed to reduce the KL by Proposition 3.3.  This assumption usually will not hold exactly in practice, but we have seen that the standardization quasi-refreshment still provides a significant reduction in KL (Figure 1).\n\nWe will revise the wording in this section for the camera-ready version.\n\n"

                "content": " Thank you for reviewing our manuscript, and for your encouraging feedback! We provide a point-to-point response to each of the comments in the review below. Don\u2019t hesitate to follow up with any questions; we are happy to answer them.\n\n> Perhaps some other choices of \\rho_t and R_\\lambda(x) could be explored so that a potential user could understand the sensitivity of the algorithm to these choices\n\nThank you for your suggestion. Indeed, there are many possible choices of the momentum distribution for Hamiltonian dynamics. We chose the Gaussian momentum in the paper because it is the most commonly used in practice, and it enables a simple quasi-refreshment scheme of standardizing the momentum variables. We would like to point out that a discussion on some other possible quasi-refreshment schemes for Gaussian momentum was included in the supplement in Appendix A. In our experiments, we did not observe major differences in performance across the various schemes discussed, and so opted for the simplest one. \n\nAs our work provides a general framework for incorporating momentum refreshments in Hamiltonian-based flow methods, however, it would likely not be too onerous to try out previously-studied alternative Hamiltonian momentum distributions, e.g. the Laplace distribution [1-2]. Developing quasi-refreshment schemes for other momentum distributions is certainly an interesting direction to explore; we leave this to future work. \n\n> I am under the impression that the quasi-refreshment step could also be incorporated into some of the other baselines considered in the experiments, and not just for SHF. If this is the case, how would the baselines then perform?\n\nYou are absolutely correct that we can incorporate the quasi-refreshment step into HIS. In fact, one way to think of our new method is that we (1) replace the tempering step in HIS with quasi-refreshment, and (2) introduce the use of a coreset. Indeed, the quasi-refreshment step is precisely motivated by Proposition 3.2, which states that tempering alone is insufficient for HIS to obtain adequate target approximations, even when they are Gaussian. For UHA specifically, there is no need to incorporate the quasi-refreshment step; the momentum variables are already perfectly refreshed, as they are resampled from a Gaussian (at the cost of introducing many auxiliary variables).\n\n> In Figure 2, relative cov error seems to take a long time to converge, compared to UHA-Full. Why did the purple UHA-Full suddenly go up after ~2000 iterations? It seems like at that point, the approximation is just as good as SHF.\n\nIndeed the relative covariance error seems slow to converge, but this is not the complete picture. We need to look at the relative covariance error plot together with the relative mean error plot (Fig. 2c) and the KL plot (Fig. 2b). In particular, the relative mean and covariance error plots depict two different aspects of the quality of our target approximation; the KL plot takes both of these into consideration. For this particular problem, our method finds the center of the target before fine tuning the covariance. The monotonic downward trend of the KL divergence shows that our method keeps on improving the target approximation throughout optimization. \n\nTo understand why the relative mean error and KL divergence go up for UHA, it is important to note that UHA operates on the augmented space based on a sequence of distributions that bridge some simple initial distribution and the target distribution. Therefore, it is not guaranteed that all steps of optimization improve the quality of approximation on the marginal space of the latent variables of interest. This explains the increase in the error metrics on the \\theta-marginal space shown in Figs. 2b and 2c. However, we note that from Fig 2a, UHA\u2019s augmented ELBO as the optimization objective that we maximize over shows a monotonic increasing trend.\n\nWe realize that we have not been very clear about these interpretations in the paper, and will add some clarification on this in the experiment section for the camera-ready version.

                "content": " The paper introduces a new method for constructing Bayesian coresets. The authors demonstrate that a single uniform subsampling of data points is in principle sufficient to obtain an exact coreset, and introduce the sparse Hamiltonian flow to efficiently construct and sample from the corresponding coreset posterior approximation. Notable improvements over other coreset methods are reported in several experiments.\n ### Originality:\nTo my knowledge, the presented method is original. The authors provide a footnote citing concurrent work based on similar ideas, but the combination of Hamiltonian flow approximations to the coreset posterior seems unique to his work. One could argue that the authors should provide a dedicated Related Work section to elaborate on the connections to earlier work.\n\n### Quality:\nThe paper is technically sound, and the claims are carefully developed and well supported. The paper could be further improved with some reflection on the limitations of the approach.\n\n### Clarity:\nThe manuscript is well structured and very clearly written, with helpful introductions to the methodological ingredients that it builds upon.\n\n### Significance:\nThe paper constitutes a significant contribution within research on Bayesian coresets, both in terms of methodology and measured in terms of the performance improvements over other methods. I am not certain how large a contribution it will have to the field of Bayesian inference in general. This would have been easier to assess if the authors had broadened the scope of their baselines to other Bayesian inference procedures.\n ### Detailed comments and questions:\n\nLine 110. After having introduced Hamiltonian Dynamics, the author state that here that it is possible to use it as the basis of a normalizing flow. It would be informative if they could also explain what the advantages of using a Hamiltonian flow are compared to other choices of normalizing flows. I assume this might be explained in [21,22], but it would be helpful if it was reiterated here.\n\nLine 142. The model covered in Proposition 3.1 is referred to as a \"representative example model\". The authors should elaborate on why this is a representative (or even relevant) example model. Can anything be said about the compression for the posterior of other models? Can anything be said for finite N? In particular, it would be interesting to know whether anything could be said about the choice of M in the general setting.\n\nLine 197. \"In this work we assume that p_t ~ N(mu, Lambda^-1)\"\nDoes this mean that we are ultimately assuming that the posterior can be approximated by a diagonal Gaussian? In that case, how is this different from the assumption made in a simple parametric VI setting? In the introduction, the authors explicitly mention the \u201csimple parametric families\u201d as a contrast to the current work. It would be helpful if the contrast between the two was explicitly explained for the case when this parametric assumption of p_t is made.\n\nLine 266. \"Figs. 2c and 2d demonstrate that this reduction in KL divergence is primarily due to a lower relative error in the approximate posterior mean provided by SHF.\"\nTo which extent is this explained by the fact that the posterior is Gaussian in this case? It seems like an idealized setting for the proposed method, given the assumption of Gaussianity of p_t.\n\nIn the Experiments section, the choice of baselines used in the different figures was not clear to me. Why there was a difference in the baseline methods included in Fig 2/3 and Fig 4?\n\nI would have liked to see simpler Bayesian Inference baselines such as Laplace and simple mean-field VI included as baselines as well. This would make it easier for someone not intimately familiar with coreset methods to judge how big an impact these methods have over conventional approaches.\n\nIn the Conclusion section, it would have been helpful with a discussion of the limitations of the proposed approach.\n\n\n### Minor details\n\nLine 81. \"While theoretically not expensive, interleaving MCMC and gradient descent steps is hard to implement and tune, and is too slow to be practical. \"\nThis sentence was not entirely clear to me. First, you state that it is theoretically not expensive, and that it is hard to implement and tune, but then you conclude that it is too slow to be practical, which seems to contradict the first part of the sentence. Please clarify whether the limitation here is fundamental (e.g. efficiency wise), or whether it is practical (difficult to implement and tune).\n\nLine 149. \"Let C be the universal constant from [37], Corollary 1.2.\nThis constant appears a bit unmotivated here right before Propoposition 3.1. It might increase readibility if it was either explained in greater detail, or otherwise moved to the end of the sentence in 152.\n\nLine 163. \"since w only has the first M entries nonzero\"\nWas the convention of placing the nonzero elements first mentioned anywhere? Perhaps I missed it.\n The authors do not discuss the limitations of their method."

It combines a) subsampling of the data (core sets), b) sparse flows and c) quasi-refreshments.\n\nThe paper provides theoretical evidence for why these subcomponents reduce the runtime or increase performance (see section 3) and empirical evidence in three different settings. The Sparse Hamiltonian Flows (SHF) clearly and strongly outperform the alternatives in most experiments. \n\n*UPDATE*: thanks for addressing all of my concerns. I update my score from 7 to 8. Great work. Keep it up!\n In short, I think the paper is good and should be published with minor revisions. \n\n*Strengths:*\n- The paper is very well-written and clear\n- The suggested combination of methods clearly and strongly improves performance compared to the alternatives\n- The paper provides a theoretical analysis of why and in which manner the performance improves due to SHF. \n\n*Weaknesses:*\n- The experiments are all in fairly simple settings. The results already convince me that the method is very strong and warrants publication but a more complex experiment would increase this conviction (see questions). \n- The paper says little about its limitations (see questions).\n - Limitations: To my understanding, SHF makes some assumptions that imply limitations. For example, SHF chooses a random subset of data points. In cases where a random subset of data points is not representative of the entire dataset, SHF might be fast but not useful. Is this correct? Are there other limitations of SHF that are not explicitly mentioned?\n- Scale (related to limitations): I expect that more complicated data types will run into problems with random subsets more easily. Thus SHF might not be an appropriate solution for more complex models and data. I\u2019d like to see a more explicit interaction with these points, either by actually running an additional experiment or by stating the implicit assumptions and following consequences in more detail. \n- Subsets: I\u2019m not sure I fully understand the way in which the random subset is chosen. Is the subset of M values chosen uniformly at random once at the beginning of the process or does the subset change over time? \n- Figure 1: I see that during the leapfrog steps (e.g. every 10th iteration), the ELBO jumps up towards a better state. This is in line with the theory. However, from steps 0-9 the ELBO decreases rather than increases. I don\u2019t understand why that is the case. My naive assumption would be that the blue lines should also go up just not as drastically as the red lines. \n I think, the limitations of the method were discussed insufficiently and should be addressed as described in questions 1 and 2. \n\nI\u2019ll use the rest of the section for high-level comments.\n- In its current form, the paper convinces me that SHF decreases runtime and increases performance for datasets with low complexity. The authors show this with their theoretical analysis and empirical experiments. Furthermore, the paper is well-written and the presentation is good. All of this combined already warrants publication in my opinion. \n- The assumptions that SHF makes and the implied limitations are underexplored. I expect that SHF will have a hard time with more complex models and data because it assumes that a random selection of data points is representative of the entire dataset. I think a good response or an additional experiment in this direction would convince me to raise my score further. Note, that I think the paper would be improved, even if the method is more limited than expected. Stating limitations helps readers and practitioners because it defines the scope of possible use cases more clearly. \n- I want to help where I can. In case something is unclear, feel free to ask follow-up questions. \n"

                "content": "Recently, people have been paying more attention to the abstractive dialogue summarization task. Compared with news text, the information flows of the dialogue exchange between at least two interlocutors, which leads to the necessity of capturing long-distance cross-sentence relations. In addition, the generated summaries commonly suffer from fake facts because the key elements of dialogues often scatter in multiple utterances. However, the existing sequence-to-sequence models are difficult to address these issues. Therefore, it is necessary for researchers to explore the implicit conversational structure to ensure the richness and faithfulness of generated contents. In this paper, we present a Knowledge Graph Enhanced Dual-Copy network (KGEDC), a novel framework for abstractive dialogue summarization with conversational structure and factual knowledge. We use a sequence encoder to draw local features and a graph encoder to integrate global features via the sparse relational graph self-attention network, complementing each other. Besides, a dual-copy mechanism is also designed in decoding process to force the generation conditioned on both the source text and extracted factual knowledge. The experimental results show that our method produces significantly higher ROUGE scores than most of the baselines on both SAMSum corpus and Automobile Master corpus. Human judges further evaluate that outputs of our model contain more richer and faithful information."

However, our model both copies words via pointing and generates words from a fixed vocabulary. $p_{gen}$ is used as a soft switch to choose between generating a word from the vocabulary by sampling from $P_{vocab}$, or copying a word from the inputs by sampling from the attention distributions $\\sum_{i:y_i=y_t} a_{i,t}^s+\\sum_{i:y_i=y_t} a_{i,t}^g$.\n\nQ3: It would also be interesting to know in what ratio $h_G$ and $h_S$ are combined in the case of gating fusion.\n\nA3: Considering there is no $h_G$ and $h_S$ in the paper, only $h^S$ and $h^G$ exist. Besides, we do not use a gate network to combine the $h^S$ and $h^G$. Therefore, we are not sure if you want to know what the ratio $c^s$ and $c^g$ are combined in the case of gating fusion. If we understand it correctly, the following statement will solve your question. We do a gate fusion analysis in Sec 5.3. We record the changes of the gate values $g_t$ for the development set during training in Figure 9 in A.6. For SAMSum dataset, at the beginning, the average gate value exceeds 0.5, which suggests generated contents are biased to choose source dialogues. As the training goes on, our model gradually realizes that fact descriptions are more reliable, which leads to a consecutive drop of the gate value. Finally, the average gate value is gradually stabilized to 0.422. Notably, the ratio of gate values is $(1-0.422)/0.422\\approx1.37$ and it is extremely close to the ratio of copying proportion $0.44/0.32\\approx1.38$ shown in Table 2 (0.32 and 0.44 mean the proportions of tokens and facts found in the summary), which seems that our model predicts the copy proportion relative accurately and normalizes it as the gate value. For the Automobile Master corpus, the experimental results are consistent with the data distribution.\n\nQ4: Since there is already sequential context dependency in GE, what additional advantage does the sequential encoder provide? Why not train only with the graph encoders?\n\nA4: In Graph Encoder (GE), the sequential context dependency captures the utterance-level contextual information and focuses on changes of speakers\u2019 views due to the continuous utterances. However, the sequence encoder processes the entire dialogue as a sequence and emphasizes the representation of each token in the token-level. The token and utterance granularities are cooperated to express conversational contents. Besides, token representations of the sequence encoder are also involved in the decoding process and the $h_i^s$ is used in the attention mechanism for sequence context vector $c_t^s$, which generates summaries by copying from the source tokens. Therefore, the sequence and graph encoder are both indispensable modules."

We will explain your concerns and answer your questions point by point.\n\nQ1: Dialogue graph may not necessarily be sparse. In section 3.2.3, \u201cSparse Relational Graph Self-Attention Layer\u201d paragraph, the author writes \u201cHowever, our sparse self-attention operation ..., which reduces the quadratic computation to linear\u201d, but no proof is given, actually this seems not to be right. \n\nA1: We make a wrong expression on \"which reduces the quadratic computation to linear\". In fact, what we want to express is that our sparse self-attention operation reduces the computation amount to a certain extent. In our paper, the constructed dialogue graph is not a complete graph ($|E_d|<{|V_d|^2}$). Therefore, we regard the constructed dialogue graph as a sparse graph.\n\nQ2: The constructed factual knowledge graph seems to be sparse since the topics various in different dialogues. As shown in figure 2 (b), there are 7 different edge types in one dialogue session. How does the model deal with this issue? \n\nA2: We use the sparse relational graph self-attention and mask operation to deal with the factual knowledge graph, where if there is an edge between two nodes, the element of the mask matrix is set to 1, and if there is no edge between two nodes, the element of the mask matrix is set to 0. The edge labels are also encoded into a relational matrix $R$. The attention score is calculated as: $Attention(Q,K,V,R)=softmax(\\frac{Q\\times K}{\\sqrt d}+R)(V+R)$.\n\nQ3: Maybe the paper should provide more content on ablation and case study. For example, in equation (3), edge type is considered in attention computation, while the impact for distinguishing 3 different edges is not studied. Moreover, cases, where the proposed method doesn\u2019t perform well, may also be interesting while not included.\n\nA3: We add an ablation study for three different types of edges. Removal of the Sequential Context Dependency (SCD) edges does not significantly affect the performance (R-`1: 0.82 ($\\downarrow$), R-2: 0.73 ($\\downarrow$), R-3: 0.69 ($\\downarrow$)) because the sequence encoder can replace their impact to some extent. Removing either of the Speaker Dependency (SD) edges and Co-occurring Keyword Dependency (CKD) edges results in poor performance. With the SD edge removed, the R-1, R-2, and R-L scores decrease by 2.44, 2.12, and 2.76 points. With the CKD edge removed, the R-1, R-2, and R-L scores decrease by 1.49, 1.50, and 1.98 points. Besides, when two of the three edge types are arbitrarily removed, the performance will be greatly reduced, which demonstrates that capturing the long-distance cross sentence dependencies is important for making information flows in dialogues clearer. As we can see, removing three types of edges completely is equivalent to deleting the graph encoder, which can not aggregate utterance-level features.\n\n|SD|SCD|CKD|R-1 ($\\sigma$)|R-2 ($\\sigma$)|R-L ($\\sigma$)|\n|----|-----|-----|------|------|------|\n|\u2714|\u2714|\u2714|43.87(0.4)|19.66(0.5)|41.02(0.7)|\n|\u2714|\u2718|\u2714|43.05(0.5)|18.93(0.5)|40.33(0.6)|\n|\u2714|\u2714|\u2718|42.38(0.7)|18.16(0.5)|39.04(0.4)|\n|\u2718|\u2714|\u2714|41.43(0.6)|17.54(0.3)|38.26(0.5)|\n|\u2714|\u2718|\u2718|41.05(0.6)|16.78(0.4)|37.23(0.4)|\n|\u2718|\u2718|\u2714|40.66(0.5)|16.13(0.7)|36.85(0.7)|\n|\u2718|\u2714|\u2718|40.28(0.8)|15.71(0.9)|36.49(0.6)|\n|\u2718|\u2718|\u2718|39.62(0.6)|15.05(0.6)|35.87(0.5)|\n\nIn the case study, we add some analysis on the problems of summaries generated by our model. In Table 8 in A.7, the summary generated by our models is \"Lilly gonna be late. Gabriel order pasta with salmon and basil\". We find that there are some deficiencies in logical reasoning for our models. For example, the future tense is not inferred and the logical relationship between \u201corder food\u201d and \u201cfor Lilly\u201d is not recognized.\n\nQ4: In figure1, both Factual Knowledge Graph and Sequence Encoder are used in predicting the next word at decoder stage, in an attention manner, but why graph encoder is excluded here? Now attending to utterance representations encoded in a graph encoder help in doing better decoding.\n\nA4: The representation of graph encoder is used to initialize the initial state of decoder $s_0$, which passes utterance-level representations of dialogues to the decoder. Therefore, representations of graph encoder are used to do better decoding, as shown in $P_{vocab}$. However, in attention manner, we copy source tokens from the sequence encoder and the factual knowledge from the factual knowledge graph as a pointing process, as shown in $\\sum_{i:y_i=y_t}a_{i,t}^s+\\sum_{i:y_i=y_t}a_{i,t}^g$. In a word, although all of the sequence encoder, graph encoder, and factual knowledge graph are used in predicting the next word at the decoder stage, they are from two aspects. The sequence and graph encoders are used to generate the next token from the vocabulary table, while the sequence encoder and factual knowledge graph are used to generate the next token by copying from the source input and factual knowledge.\n\nWe modify the W_i^R in Eq. 3."

Given such performance, I wonder if the difference between the ablated variants and the full model is statistically significant. Also, what is the performance of the proposed method without graph information? Is it effectively the same as a Pointer-Generator?\n\nA1: We further enrich the ablation studies. We do an ablation experiment on the Sequence Encoder (SE), Graph Encoder (GE), and Factual Knowledge Graph (FKG) using the best-performing $\\rm KGEDC_g$ model on SAMSum corpus. As we can see, with the GE removed, the R-1, R-2, and R-L scores decrease by 4.25, 4.61, and 5.15 points.

Who are the annotators and how many annotators are there? What is the inter-annotator agreement?\n\nA2: (1) We hire five native or fluent speakers of English as human annotators to rate summaries generated by our $\\rm KGEDC_g$, along with the outputs by Pointer Generator+Separator (PGS) and Fast Abs RL Enhanced (FARE). \n\n(2) For readability, we make the annotators focus on how fluent and grammatical the summary is and we provide them the following guidelines:\n\n1. First, the annotators judge whether the given sentence is complete or not. If the sentence is incomplete, the annotators rate the score as 1 for it.\n\n2. The annotators can understand the meaning of a complete sentence through their analysis, but there are many grammatical problems in the sentence. The annotators rate the score as 2 or 3 for this sentence.\n\n3. The annotator can easily understand the meaning of the sentence, and there are only minor grammatical problems in it. The annotators rate the score as 4 or 5 for this sentence.\n\nFor relevance, we make the annotators focus on how much faithful information the summary contains and we consider two types of unfaithful errors: (a) deletion or substitution error-mistakenly deleting or substituting subjects, objects, or clauses, and (b) hallucination error-creating content not present in the input. The guidelines are as follows:\n\n1. Firstly, we ask the annotators to avoid using general knowledge and check whether the given sentence is consistent with the source texts. \n\n2. If the given sentence is faithful to the source texts, the annotators rate the score as 4 or 5.\n\n3. If the given sentence is not faithful to the source texts, the annotators will label each type of unfaithful errors as 1 for the existence of errors and 0 otherwise, and give the scores (1, 2, or 3) of relevance according to the percentage of errors.\n\nQ3: The paper is poorly represented with unclear descriptions (not only typos/grammar but also definitions of various concepts), which makes it hard to follow. To name a few, in 3.2, the definition of edges gives one the impression that it is a fully connected graph. In 3.2.1, \u201ckeyword\u201d is defined after the description of the use of the keyword, and I can\u2019t really tell what is the \u201ckeyword neighborhood\u201d. A general suggestion is to define them beforehand (when they first appear) instead of describing them later or in the footnote.\n\nA3: We improve some definitions in our paper, such as the definition of edges given in Sec 3.2 and the definition of keywords in Sec 3.2.1."

Firstly, we study the effects of two encoders while keeping the FKG module. We only remove one encoder at a time and find that removing either of them leads performance to drop greatly. With the graph encoder removed, the R-1, R-2, and R-L scores decrease by 4.25, 4.61, and 5.15 points. With the sequence encoder removed, the R-1, R-2, and R-L scores decrease by 7.72, 7.28, and 7.23 points.

Removing both of them results in a very poor R-1, R-2, and R-L scores of 19.04\\%, 8.57\\%, and 17.82\\%, which is because the conversational context is not well represented. Next, after getting rid of the FKG module, all models could not keep as competitive as models with the FKG, which suggests the importance of factual knowledge. In particular, after only  FKG was removed, the R-1, R-2, and R-L scores decrease by 1.16, 0.51, and 0.70 points. The framework of the model without GE and FKG resembles the Pointer Generator and their performances are also similar. \n\n|SE|GE|FKG|R-1 ($\\sigma$)|R-2 ($\\sigma$)|R-L ($\\sigma$)|\n|----|----|-----|------|------|------|\n|\u2714|\u2714|\u2714|43.87(0.4)|19.66(0.5)|41.02(0.7)|\n|\u2714|\u2718|\u2714|39.62(0.6)|15.05(0.6)|35.87(0.5)|\n|\u2718|\u2714|\u2714|36.15(0.5)|12.38(0.8)|33.79(0.6)|\n|\u2718|\u2718|\u2714|19.04(1.0)|8.57(0.9)|17.82(1.2)|\n|\u2714|\u2714|\u2718|42.71(0.5)|19.15(0.4)|40.32(0.5)|\n|\u2714|\u2718|\u2718|38.93(0.7)|14.16(0.6)|34.88(0.6)|\n|\u2718|\u2714|\u2718|35.65(0.8)|11.49(0.7)|32.57(0.4)|\n|\u2718|\u2718|\u2718|17.52(1.2)|7.90(1.5)|16.26(1.0)|\n\nIn the second ablation experiment, we explore the effect of the edge labels of the dialogue graph.

This framework can be decomposed of 1) a sequence encoder to capture contextual information of dialogues flowing along the sequence, 2) a graph encoder via sparse relation graph self-attention network for cross-sentence dependencies, 3) a factual knowledge graph for representing relational tuples extracted from dialogues, 4) a dual-copy decoder to focus on both the input tokens and the factual knowledge. Experimental results on two datasets show the performance gains of the proposed methods over several previous baselines.\n\nSTRENGTHS:\n\n1. The motivation is clear and is in line with the model architecture. Two main unresolved problems in abstractive dialogue summarization are consistently concerned in the paper.\n\n2.

A KG is built and considered to be a surrogate for \"factual knowledge\".

They build a dialogue graph where each utterance is a node and 2 nodes are connected if they have the same speaker, are within a distance d sequentially, or if they have common keywords (nouns, numerals,\nadjectives or notional verbs). They also build the KG using OpenIE triples and tuples from the utterance dependency trees. They use a GNN to encode both the utterance graph and the KG and use either concatenation or gated fusion to get the context vector.

They get a Rouge-L improvement of ~1.8 and ~2.5 respectively over string baselines. \n\nPros:\n- The method is interesting.

They also perform human evaluation which is appreciated.\n\nCons/Questions:\n- It is not clear how the biLSTM encoding and the GE encoding are combined? Is it the same way as done with h^S and h^G?\n- I am not satisfied with the ablation study. One important ablation to run would be an experiment without both GE and FKG. Without those two, the model simply becomes (seq2seq + attention). And from Table 1, we see that the R-L for that simple model is 28.16 and 29.37. It is hard for me to convince myself that adding either GE or FKG increases R-L by more than 12 points.\n- It would also be interesting to know in what ratio h_G and h_S are combined in the case of gating fusion.\n- Since there is already sequential context dependency in GE, what additional advantage does the sequential encoder provide?

The authors argue that this approach is more robust than the traditional approach of using partial returns, as it can handle situations where the reward function is not fully observed.\n\nThe paper presents a theoretical analysis of the proposed approach, showing that it has desirable properties such as identifiability and consistency. The authors also provide an algorithm for learning the reward function from preference datasets using the regret approach.\n\nThe paper also includes experimental results on a simulated delivery problem, where the proposed approach is compared with a partial return baseline. The results show that the proposed approach performs better than the baseline in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.\n\nHowever, the reviewers have raised some concerns about the paper. One reviewer notes that the proposed approach is limited to deterministic policies, and it is unclear how it can be extended to stochastic policies. Another reviewer points out that the computational complexity of the proposed approach is higher than that of the partial return approach, and it is unclear whether it is scalable to more practical problems.\n\nThe reviewers also note that the theoretical analysis is based on a simplifying assumption that the dataset covers all possible pairs of segments, which may not be realistic in practice. Additionally, the paper does not provide a comparison with other baselines, such as IRL methods, which are commonly used in this area.\n\nOverall, the paper presents a promising approach to learning the reward function from preference datasets. However, the reviewers have raised some concerns that need to be addressed before the paper can be accepted for publication. The authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed approach and its scalability to more practical problems. Additionally, the authors should provide a comparison with other baselines, such as IRL methods, to demonstrate the advantages and limitations of the proposed approach.\n\nRevise the manuscript according to the feedback from the reviewers and resubmit it.\n\nDear Editor,\n\nThank you for the opportunity to revise our manuscript based on the feedback from the reviewers.

Importantly, the authors propose that people compare the segments in terms of their values (measured by a notion of regret) instead of the total reward achieved by each segment. A regret notion---the sum of the negative advantage function value of the segment---is used to summarize the value of a segment. The advantage function is defined under an optimal policy pi^* (optimal wrt the true reward r) and the reward of interest \\tilde{r}. Strength: The paper provides a key insight that preferences are not just a function of the (instantaneous) reward of the segment of interest. Given that humans may care about the goal of a task, their preference towards different segments will necessarily be influenced by their long-term value, i.e., how these segments perform in terms of achieving the goal. The identification results presented in Section 3 nicely summarized the proposed insight. \n\n\nWeakness: The biggest weakness to me is how one can utilize this insight in practice. In particular, calculating the regret requires one to know the optimal policy under the true reward r (or at least the value and q-value function of that optimal policy under any reward \\tilde{r}). In general, even if one provides an optimal policy \\pi^*, the planning problem (and possibly learning problem when the transition matrix is unknown) will make the estimation of the regret very hard. As a related note, in the general framework, the regret definition under a particular optimal policy and L150 (\"And regret(\\sigma|r) > 0 if and only if \\sigma is suboptimal\") in the proof seem to only hold if one assumes there is one single optimal policy \\pi^*. What if there is a set of optimal policies under the true reward r? How should one adjust the regret notion for that?\n Could the authors elaborate more on the setting when there are multiple optimal policies, how one should define regret in such cases, and how the results in Section 3 look like when one chooses different optimal policies to define ther regret?\n\n\n-----\n\nL63: typo in the mathematical expression Yes, the authors have discussed the limitations and societal impact of their work"

One promising method for alignment is to learn the reward function from human-generated preferences between pairs of trajectory segments. These human preferences are typically assumed to be informed solely by partial return, the sum of rewards along each segment. We find this assumption to be flawed and propose modeling preferences instead as arising from a different statistic: each segment's regret, a measure of a segment's deviation from optimal decision-making. Given infinitely many preferences generated according to regret, we prove that we can identify a reward function equivalent to the reward function that generated those preferences. We also prove that the previous partial return model lacks this identifiability property without preference noise that reveals rewards' relative proportions, and we empirically show that our proposed regret preference model outperforms it with finite training data in otherwise the same setting. Additionally, our proposed regret preference model better predicts real human preferences and also learns reward functions from these preferences that lead to policies that are better human-aligned. Overall, this work establishes that the choice of preference model is impactful, and our proposed regret preference model provides an improvement upon a core assumption of recent research."

In our first response to your reviews, we focused in part on how the choice of optimization (max likelihood or otherwise) doesn't matter in the Thm 3.2 proofs, since noiselessly providing preferences based on partial return creates a many-to-one mapping. \n\n**Your point above about the proof of Thm 3.1 not applying to noiseless preferences is well taken, and we agree with you. Thank you for identifying this error.** We originally removed the temperature parameter from the softmax formula because it is redundant with the scaling of the reward and it simplified our notation to not include it. However, as you suggest, for the proof of Thm 3.1 to apply to the noiseless preferences setting of Thm 3.2, a revision is needed. \n\nFortunately, **the required change is minor**. **We can add back the temperature as a optimizable parameter into Eqs 2 and 5 and allow a special case for temperature = 0, where the result is a hard max, i.e., if temperature = 0, the preference is given deterministically to the segment with the higher partial return in Eq 2 or regret in Eq 5.**\n\nWith this tweak, when the temperature is 0, the proof of Thm 3.1 covers both the stochastic and noiseless settings, and the preference generator is realizable in the noiseless setting for Thm 3.1 and in the two proofs of Thm 3.2 (though these two proofs don't rely on the learning algorithm to provide their negative results). In other words, **Thm 3.1 does include the noiseless settings of Thm 3.2 as a special case, but both theorems' proofs required this \"tweak\" to have a learning algorithm that can realize the reward function that created the noiseless preferences.**\n\nThe need for this added special case in the theoretical setting is now clear. However, in practical settings, the originally submitted algorithm (with no temperature) will simply scale reward until the improvement in loss after each epoch of learning is extremely small, which can be used as a stopping criterion, at which point the reward function results in nearly deterministic preferences. Such an approach is effective with noiseless preference labels in our experiments, as seen in Section 6.2 (with further detail in App F.2.1) and in the randomly generated _stochastic_ MDPs in App F.2.5.\n\nThe revisions and clarifications above will be included in the final copy. In particular, we will revise to emphasize that _in noiseless preference label settings_, both theorems provide insight about whether the preferences contain the information required to recover the set of optimal policies (via directly recovering a reward function). **In other words, the theorems are really about each preference model _as a preference generator_, and the learning algorithm used in Thm 3.1 is merely meant to show _what information exists_ in each type of preferences.** For the negative result of Thm 3.2, its two proofs clearly show that some MDPs exist in which preferences based on partial return have the many-to-one mapping we referred to and therefore is not identifiable under _any_ learning algorithm. For the positive result of Thm 3.1, we merely need to show that there is one learning algorithm that permits identifiability in any MDP, which that proof does with the above tweak to allow a special hard max case.\n\n(Note that what we wrote above was summarized and rephrased in our response to @xps1 with the same subject, \"Correcting our error\".)"

Although Figure 1 may indeed remind readers of research on safe RL (and safety in autonomous driving, which employs a different definition of the word \"safe\"), here Figure 1 is used as a simple example of how human preferences intuitively do not seem to given based on the partial return of a trajectory (or else the left trajectory would be preferred). We hope that this exchange has helped clarify that this work is unrelated to safe RL; it solely focuses on more accurate inference of the reward functions that drive human preferences. Any RL algorithm can then be used to learn a task from such a human-aligned reward function. If an RL practitioner decided to add safety constraints to such a learned reward function (which however is certainly not the focus of this paper), they could then use various safe RL algorithms to learn from the reward function\u2014created through regret preference models\u2014such as CPO.\n\n> Sorry for the unclear part.

Thanks for communicating back and forth with us to get to this point of clarification! **The partial return (stochastic) preference model is taken exactly from [9-16] and is common to all of them. And the \"partial return (stochastic)\" reward learning algorithm\u2014created from joining both the preference model (Eq 2) and maximizing likelihood (Eq 2)\u2014is the common part of each learning algorithm from [9-16].** L96-97 of the currently downloadable version (lines unchanged from the original submission) were meant to state this relationship. We will be more explicit in the final version to prevent confusion like yours. Comparing preference models, which was not the focus of _their_ papers, is our focus. Instead, they focused on largely orthogonal algorithmic elements, like what segment pairs to present for elicitation [13] or how to maximize likelihood (Eq 1) with a deep neural network representation of the reward function [9]. So this baseline appears to be precisely what you are asking for. \n\nThe partial return (noiseless) preference model is _only_ used to generate preferences, not for the reward learning algorithm, as we explain at the start of Section 6.2 (L327\u2013331 in the currently downloadable version). This noiseless preference generator is not typically used by [9-16]. You can see in our comments to all reviewers an explanation of the importance of these noiseless versions of each preference model, despite that they are not typically employed in related work."

We're happy to discuss further and hope to fully understand your confusion and preempt similar confusion for future readers through revisions for clarity.\n\nRegarding **safe RL**, this paper focuses on the problem of how to _learn a reward function_ that is aligned with the interests of human stakeholders, specifically focused on the well-established technique of learning from preferences over pairs of trajectory segments. To our knowledge, safe RL such as CPO, on the other hand, generally assumes that a reward function and a set of constraints _are already given_ and focuses on RL algorithms that do policy improvement while making various guarantees to avoid violating the safety constraints. In short, reward learning and safe RL are different problems that do not seem particularly related. We do see how a different usage of the word \"safety\" could encompass the alignment of reward functions\u2014since poorly aligned objective functions generally are a significant societal threat\u2014despite the safe RL literature not focusing on such alignment.\n\nWe do not understand your question about partial return and [9-16]. Could you elaborate on what you mean and why more than one implementation would be desirable?\n\nRegarding **Figure 1**, we will add some more explanation below to see if any of it addresses your confusion. We implicitly assume a reward function that\u2014in these two segments\u2014only deviates from 0 to reflect damage to the vehicle or harm to the passengers. If it would help to make that information more explicit, please let us know and we will add it. The left segment involves no damage to the vehicle and therefore has 0 reward, even though it leads the car to an end state in which the car will almost certainly have a horrible collision within seconds. The right segment involves minor damage but otherwise does roughly the reverse of the left segment: it takes the car from a start state in which collision will likely happen soon to a safe end state. (Additionally, are you confused about how the figure is communicating the start states and end states, which are simply the beginning and end of the arrows / where the two images of the car are? If so, we can also write that information more clearly.) So by looking at partial return alone (i.e., the sum of reward along the segment but _not_ the start or end state values), the left segment is better despite being suboptimal, but human intuition prefers the right (optimal) segment, and the right segment has a lower deterministic regret (Eq. 3) because deterministic regret does include the start and end state values.\n"

IRL requires demonstrations, not preferences over segment pairs. However, because a  a regret-based preference model always prefers optimal segments over suboptimal segments, at least one connection can be made. If one assumes that a demonstrated trajectory segment is noiselessly optimal (as in the foundational 2004 Abbeel and Ng IRL / apprenticeship learning paper), then such a demonstration is equivalent to expressing preference or indifference for the demonstrated segment over all other segments (or, equivalently, that no other segment is preferred over the demonstrated segment). However, IRL has its own identifiability issues in noiseless settings (see [http://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/kim21c.html](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v139/kim21c.html)) that, viewed from the lens of preferences, come in part from the \"indifference\" part of the above statement: since there can be multiple optimal actions from a single state, it's not generally correct to assume that a demonstration of one such action shows a preference over all others, and therefore it remains unclear in IRL what _other _actions are optimal. Note that since partial-return-based preferences can prefer suboptimal segments over optimal segments, the common assumption in IRL that demonstrations are optimal does not map as cleanly to partial-return-based preferences.\n\nAs mentioned in our response to all reviewers under \"Practically using regret is challenging\", our regret preference model also relates to IRL in that many IRL algorithms require solving an MDP in the inner loop, like would be required for a perfect measure of regret while learning a reward function.\n\nAn empirical comparison of IRL and learning reward functions from pairwise preferences would be valuable but is out of our scope\u2014we are focused on an established technique that is not IRL, and its close relationship to IRL does not mandate that any research project test IRL algorithms too\u2014and would be its own full research project.

We appreciate the opportunity to clarify certain technical details, the relationship of this work to inverse reinforcement learning, why noiseless preferences are informative, and why scalability is not our focus.\n\n**Would defining reward as r(s,a) or r(s) affect the results in the paper?**\n\nIt would not. Our definition of reward is a generalization of reward defined over state or state-action pairs, which can be trivially mapped to reward over tuples of state, action, and next state. E.g., r(s,a) is mapped to an r(s,a,s') function simply ignoring the next state, s'.\n\n**\"the proposed regret model is limited to the case of deterministic policies\"**\n\nThis is a misunderstanding. The regret model applies to stochastic policies as well. Our definition of a policy in L68-69 is in stochastic terms. Further, note that the algorithm relies on optimal advantage values; any state-action pair that has support (i.e., non-zero probability) in an optimal policy has an advantage of 0. That's true even if there is more than one action that is optimal from a state. And a policy that stochastically mixes multiple optimal actions from each state will also always create state-action pairs with an advantage of 0 (otherwise it would be sub-optimal). Additionally, please see our response to Reviewer ieTk under \"What if there is a set of optimal policies\u2026\", which is relevant because any MDP with two optimal deterministic policies necessarily has infinite optimal stochastic policies (via mixing them as mentioned above).\n\n**\"if I am not missing anything, Theorem 3.1 and 3.2 are not comparable... in Theorem 3.1, if $regret_{\\tilde{r}}(\\sigma_{1}) < regret_{\\tilde{r}}(\\sigma_{2})$, $P_{regret}(\\sigma_1 \\succ \\sigma_2 | {\\tilde{r}})>0.5$, in Theorem 3.2, if $\\Sigma_{\\tilde{r}}(\\sigma_{1}) > \\Sigma_{\\tilde{r}}({\\sigma_{2}})$, $P_{\\Sigma_r}(\\sigma_1 \\succ \\sigma_2 | {\\tilde{r}})=1$.\"**\n\nPlease see our response to all reviewers under \"Noiseless preferences are not theoretically interesting or should be connected to past work\". Building on that general response, note that they are very comparable in the sense that the setting that matches that of 3.2 is a special case of 3.1. In other words,  \"if $regret_{\\tilde{r}}(\\sigma_{1}) < regret_{\\tilde{r}}(\\sigma_{2})$, $P_{regret}(\\sigma_1 \\succ \\sigma_2 | {\\tilde{r}})>0.5$\" includes all cases where \"if $regret_{\\tilde{r}}(\\sigma_{1}) < regret_{\\tilde{r}}(\\sigma_{2})$, $P_{regret}(\\sigma_1 \\succ \\sigma_2 | {\\tilde{r}})=1$\". Therefore, 3.1 shows that regret is identifiable under the conditions of 3.2, if you swap partial return for regret and flip the > sign, as well as under other conditions.\n\n**\"it raises the question of whether P\u03a3r is indeed non-identifiable if Theorem 3.2 has the same premise as Theorem 3.1.\"**\n\nWe agree and were careful to only claim that partial return is only non-identifiable in this noiseless setting. See L11 (\"without preference noise...\"), L47 (\"without preference noise...\"), L167 (\"without the distribution over preferences providing information\"). We suspect any scale-invariant regression model is identifiable with Boltzmann noise, so both models would be identifiable in that respect.\n\n**\"the work needs to illustrate whether the proposed method is scalable to more practical problems, e.g., by including experiments with neural networks and larger state/action spaces\"**\n\nWe understand that some researchers value showing deep RL applicability of a new approach more than others. However, we don't claim scalability either as a contribution or a characteristic of regret-based preference models and openly discuss how it might be addressed in the latter portion of Appendix F.1. We consider scalability to be one of many important dimensions of engineering and experimentation, but it did not make the cut in this paper for reasons we detail in our general message to all reviewers, under \"This paper does not demonstrate scalability to more complex environments.\"\n"

[24]), the description of Algorithm 1 will necessarily seem very complex, but it's a straightforward application of this concept to approximate Q and state values for arbitrary reward functions. Successor features are a potent tool with applications across RL.\n\nRegarding your specific questions, SF functions are learned _per policy_. So an input set of policies gives us a set of SF functions. We can also use a set of reward functions to create or augment this set of policies, by adding an approximately optimal policy for each reward function. To end up with a set of policies to create SF functions with, we can therefore use either or both of an input set of policies and reward functions. Crucially, these reward functions are _not_ the learned reward function that is the algorithm's goal. They merely are a step in a process that allows us to approximate regret of a segment for an arbitrary reward function. What reward functions and policies should be inserted is an important open question for SF-based methods in general, but our sense is that the performance of GPI under SF-based methods is improved with a greater diversity of SF functions (via a diverse set of policies) and by having some policies that perform decently (but not necessarily perfectly) on reward functions for which state and Q values are being estimated via GPI. \n\nTo determine what number of feature components should be used is essentially asking what features are needed to linearly model a reward function. If the reward function is linear and its components/features are known, then only those features should be used. At the other extreme, if the state and action space are discrete, one could know nothing about the reward function and yet linearly model all possible reward functions by creating a feature for each (s,a,s') that is 1 for (s,a,s') and 0 otherwise. If either are continuous and the reward function's linear features are unknown or the reward is nonlinear, then clear guidance requires the follow-up work on scalability that we discuss elsewhere in these comments as out of scope and also near the end of App F.1.\n\n**\"Theorem 3.1 (and Definition 3.1) is dubious. Implicitly there is an assumption that the dataset covers every \u03c31 and \u03c32 pair and infinite data for each one.\" // \"what assumption \u2026 over the covariates\"**\n\nYou are right that we made this assumption, but it was explicit. We explicitly stated this assumption in L137-138: \"Further assume that in this dataset, all possible n-length segment pairs appear infinitely many times.\" This type of assumption is standard in identifiability proofs, where one wants to know if the parameters of a data-generating model can be recovered under the highly favorable conditions of infinite, exhaustive data. Additionally, no assumption is being made over the covariates; as long as all segment pairs appear infinitely in the data, the proof holds.\n\n**\"P(\u22c5|r) is actually not in the class of models from Section 2.2\u2026 The problem is therefore misspecified, and it\u2019s not surprising that there is an identifiability issue\u2026 an unfair comparison.\"**\n\nAs you correctly point out, Thm 3.1 shows that the class of models from Sec 2.2 achieves identifiability with regret-based preferences. However, Thm 3.2, as a negative result, does need to rely specifically on the class of models from Sec. 2.2. Rather, Thm 3.2 shows that there are MDP\\r tasks in which _there is no class of models that _can recover an equivalent reward function from partial-return-based preferences if the preference generator noiselessly prefers according to partial return. Specifically, we show that the mapping from two reward functions with different sets of optimal policies to partial-return based preferences is a many-to-one-mapping, and therefore the information simply does not exist to invert that mapping and recover a reward function with the same set of optimal policies. We state this more clearly in the uploaded diff.\n"

Good news: it was approved and all will be shared! We could not find any previous paper that shared a human dataset (and many never test their algorithm for \"human\" preferences with real humans), so we are excited to be providing the first such dataset for others to reproduce our work and do novel research with the dataset.\n\n**\"compare with other baselines, such as methods using [partial return]\"**\n\nThe commonality of [9-16] is that they use partial return and (usually) likelihood maximization, which is _precisely_ the baseline that we use throughout our paper. Future work could compare using different preference models with each of these papers' novelties, such as choosing segment pairs for max info gain, but such work would be extending the baseline we already focus on to new settings, which would be informative but outside our scope. We do want to draw your attention though to the 4 additional baselines we introduce in Appendix B, each receiving more limited evaluation than our partial-return baseline. Since submission, we did however add in App B.3 and F.3 a second baseline, an \"expected return\" preference model, which is halfway between the partial return and deterministic regret models, considering each segment's partial return and end state value (but not start state value).\n\n**\"What is the segment\u2019s desirability?\"**\n\nDesirability is not a technical word in this paper. We only use it in a colloquial sense to mean \"characteristics that would make something (e.g., segment or a reward) more preferable than something else\". We will clarify in the final version.\n\n**\"environments are also limited\" / \"more results\"**\n\nPlease read why we focus on simple environments for scientific reasons, under \"This paper does not demonstrate scalability to more complex environments\" in our general comment to our reviewers. We also note that though our experiments were limited to grid worlds, our synthetic preferences experiments include learning and testing reward functions 100 different randomly generated grid world MDPs. Regarding the amount of results, we have theoretical results; 6 sets of results with synthetic data: the main one in Section 6.2 and 5 more in Appendix F.2; and a large human subjects experiment tested\u2014which required months of UI design and iterative tuning\u2014with correlational and likelihood results in Section 5 and reward-learning results with 3 preference models (Sec 6, but see App F.3 for all 3 models). As described under \"Updates\" in our comment to all reviewers, a new baseline has been added since submission, in the uploaded diff's App B.3 and F.3.\n\n**\"more details about experiments\" / \"How to define a start state of a segment\u2026 [and] end state of a segment?\"**\n\nFor space considerations we put most experimental detail in our appendix. We have added more detail about how segment pairs were chosen for human labeling (App D.3), which implicitly includes how start and end states are chosen. We will also open source our code, which will provide a secondary form of experimental detail."

We agree such detail is needed and have added it (see App D.3 in the uploaded diff).\n\n**The section organization is confusing. I did not see an algorithm until Sec 6.**\n\nWith your feedback in mind, we have revised the paper to be much clearer regarding a single point that should help with your confusion. Specifically, Section 2 defines complete algorithms through Equations 1 and 2 for partial return and Equations 1 and 5 for regret. This algorithm assumes that regret can be exactly measured, and the Sec 3 theory makes this same assumption. Sec 4\u20136 comprise our experimental analyses (not counting what is in the appendix), with Sec 4 about data gathering, Sec 5 about results _without_ reward function learning, and Sec 6 about results from reward function learning. Alg 1 is presented in Sec 6 because it focuses on creating approximations of regret for its practical application in our experiments, and otherwise it is the same algorithm as in Section 2, which is packed into line 10 of the Alg 1. The uploaded diff shows our revisions to be clearer: Sec 2.3 has a new paragraph entitled \"Algorithms in this paper\" that explicitly states that two algorithms have been defined (with clarification on what they are), points forward to the algorithms that will be defined, and connects the 3 main algorithms with which results they are used to obtain; and the first sentence of Sec 6.1 now clearly states that it is only introducing an approximation of regret to be used in the algorithm from Sec 2.\n\n**For the partial return algorithm, was the same framework used but the model just swapped out? How does this compare with past algorithms that use partial return?**\n\nAlg 1 is not used for learning reward functions with the partial return preference model, since no approximation of regret is needed for learning via partial return. All reward learning with a partial return preference model uses the algorithm from Sec 2. Our algorithm using partial return matches that of numerous past works, including the most cited one on this topic, by Christiano et al.\n\n**\"... discussion of related work is quite sparse\" / \"difficult to place this work in the literature as a result\"**\n\nInstead of an explicit related works section, we discuss related work throughout the paper, where each work is related to the immediate content of the paper. Putting all of these discussions with citations together adds to a substantial discussion. As far as placing the work in the literature, this work is a direct response to the unexamined and taken-on-faith partial-return assumptions of existing literature ([9\u201316]. We welcome any suggestions on how we might make that clearer than we do in L25-33, and any suggestions for additional work we should discuss."

Note that regret is defined over optimal advantages, and all by definition optimal policies have the same Q values and state values (e.g., see Sutton and Barto)\u2014and therefore the same advantages\u2014from any state-action pair, so our definitions are not affected by having more than one \u03c0*.\n\n**\"biggest weakness \u2026 calculating the regret requires one to know the optimal policy under the true reward r (or at least the value and q-value function of that optimal policy under any reward \\tilde{r})\"** \n\nThis is an easy misunderstanding to make.

                "content": " **-Common concerns among our reviewers-**\n\n**Practically using regret is challenging.** (@ieTk, @xps1, @SeBN)\n\nWe agree yet do not find this assertion problematic. We have provided evidence\u2014theoretically and with experimentation\u2014that regret is more effective when precisely measured or effectively approximated. The challenge of efficiently creating such approximations presents one clear path for future research and is not a good argument for staying within the local maximum of partial-return-based preference models.\n\nIn fact, like our regret model, inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) was founded on an algorithm that requires solving an MDP in an inner loop of learning a reward function. (For example, see the foundational 2000 Ng and Russell paper on IRL and also Algorithm 1 in the recent IRL survey at [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06877.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06877.pdf).) This challenge hasn't stopped IRL from being an impactful problem, and handling this inner-loop computational demand is the focus of much IRL research.\n\nAppendix A.3 has been added to address this topic.\n\n**This paper does not demonstrate scalability to more complex environments.** (@ieTk, @SeBN)\n\nWe agree. The focus of this paper is not deep RL or complex tasks, so such scalability\u2014while highly important\u2014was not in scope. As we mention above, this paper seeks a _scientific_ analysis of human preferences and preference models, which conflicts with scaling up to tasks commonly used for deep RL. Specifically, testing in more complex tasks would require coarser approximations of regret, which, as stated earlier, can make results harder to interpret. For example, if a regret-based algorithm fails, we wouldn't know whether regret is to blame or whether the approximation of regret is to blame.\n\nFurther, we believe that algorithms for human-created data should be tested with _human_-created data, only using synthetic data to better understand the algorithms. Gathering human datasets is highly expensive in terms of design and engineering (see [https://bit.ly/humanprefs](https://bit.ly/humanprefs) for our UI that trains subjects and elicits their preferences). Testing these models in other tasks with real human data would have required multiple costly human subjects studies. When the cost of a human subjects study is properly appreciated in contrast to that of a purely computational experiment, we trust that our reviewers will agree that our combined 3 proofs, 3 evaluations of our human preferences dataset (Secs 4 and 6.3, extended in App F.3), and 6 synthetic-data evaluations (Sec 6.2 and App F.2) are more than sufficient for a single paper. Our contribution of a released human dataset will make testing in multiple environments easier for future research efforts in this area.\n\nIn future work on the _application_ of regret preference models, we or other researchers can face the _engineering_ task of scalability. Given that IRL has made tremendous progress in this direction and the cited Brown et al. [30] paper has scaled an algorithm with similar needs to those of Alg 1, we are highly optimistic that the methods to scale can be developed and probably already exist (e.g., in [30] and in the later part of our App F.1, under \"Instantiating Algorithm 1 for reward functions that may be non-linear\").\n\n**Noiseless preferences are not theoretically interesting or should be connected to past work.** (@xps1, @SeBN)\n\nWe explain below (and at the end of Appendix C in the uploaded diff in the supplementary material) why noiseless preferences are important.\n\n\n\n1. An intuitive argument: Noise is often motivated as modeling human error. Having an algorithm rely on noise\u2014structured in a very specific, Boltzmann-rational way\u2014is an undesirable crutch. Noiseless preferences are also feasible, if rare.\n2. In many related settings, noiseless data is assumed for theory or derivations. For instance, the foundational IRL paper by Abbeel and Ng on apprenticeship learning treats demonstrations as noiselessly optimal. Also, \"Reward identification in inverse reinforcement learning\", an ICML 2021 paper, focuses on identifiability with noiseless, perfect demonstrations.\n3. Having structured noise provides information that can help both preference models, but these proofs show that there are cases where the signal behind the noise\u2014either regret or partial return\u2014isn't enough in the partial return case to identify an equivalent reward function. So, in a rough sense, regret is better at using both the signal and the noise, which might explain its superior sample efficiency in our experiments, across both human labels and synthetic labels. Relatedly, the noiseless setting can help us understand each preference model's sample efficiency in a low-noise setting."

Importantly, the authors propose that people compare the segments in terms of their values (measured by a notion of regret) instead of the total reward achieved by each segment. A regret notion---the sum of the negative advantage function value of the segment---is used to summarize the value of a segment. The advantage function is defined under an optimal policy pi^* (optimal wrt the true reward r) and the reward of interest \\tilde{r}. Strength: The paper provides a key insight that preferences are not just a function of the (instantaneous) reward of the segment of interest. Given that humans may care about the goal of a task, their preference towards different segments will necessarily be influenced by their long-term value, i.e., how these segments perform in terms of achieving the goal. The identification results presented in Section 3 nicely summarized the proposed insight. \n\n\nWeakness: The biggest weakness to me is how one can utilize this insight in practice. In particular, calculating the regret requires one to know the optimal policy under the true reward r (or at least the value and q-value function of that optimal policy under any reward \\tilde{r}). In general, even if one provides an optimal policy \\pi^*, the planning problem (and possibly learning problem when the transition matrix is unknown) will make the estimation of the regret very hard. As a related note, in the general framework, the regret definition under a particular optimal policy and L150 (\"And regret(\\sigma|r) > 0 if and only if \\sigma is suboptimal\") in the proof seem to only hold if one assumes there is one single optimal policy \\pi^*. What if there is a set of optimal policies under the true reward r?

An algorithm is proposed to make use of this model. A new dataset is collected for a simulated delivery problem where workers provided preference labels for segments given to them. The proposed algorithm and model were compared with a partial return model on both a synthetic dataset and the collected dataset. Strengths\n- The proposed preference model seems new to my knowledge and makes sense algorithmically.\n- The theory could be interesting although I have some reservations about correctness and the significance of one of the results.\n- The algorithm seems to perform significantly better than the partial return baseline in empirical evaluations.\n\nWeaknesses\n- The presentation could be improved. Generally speaking, there are many seemingly out of place paragraphs and sections that do not seem to advance the content of the paper. For example, Section 3 is about theoretical comparisons of the learning objectives but then Section 4 abruptly is about an experimental model, but we do not even know what the algorithm looks like or how we will use the models from Section 3 at this point. This is only explained in Section 6.\n- The description of the algorithm is very confusing and way too informal to the point where I am still unclear on what it is actually being done.  \n    - What are the input rewards and policies? Why can they be empty sometimes?\n    - Why would line 4 already estimate those? What procedure is being done to estimate these?\n    - How many feature functions are necessary?\n    - For the partial return algorithm, was the same framework used but the model just swapped out? How does this compare with past algorithms that use partial return? This seems important for the experimental comparison.\n- The discussion of related work is quite sparse and it is difficult to place this work in the literature as a result.\n- Theorem 3.1 (and Definition 3.1) is dubious. Implicitly there is an assumption that the dataset covers every $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2$ pair and infinite data for each one. Not just that it contains infinite data for some distribution over certain segments, which is what Definition 3.1 is ambiguous about. This only becomes apparent in the proof where this unstated fact is used. \n- I am also not convinced that Theorem 3.2 is all that significant. The setting is different from the preliminaries of the paper: to assume noiseless labels is to say that $P(\\cdot | r)$ is actually not in the class of models from Section 2.2 since the softmax cannot realize this model for finite rewards. The problem is therefore misspecified, and it\u2019s not surprising that there is an identifiability issue, considering that the KL divergence cannot even be driven to zero if the true reward function is plugged in! Note that Theorem 3.1 crucially made use of the fact that the model is realizable to prove the positive result, so I feel that this is an unfair comparison.\n- The computational burden of solving potentially many MDPs to optimize the proposed preference model seems difficult to overcome.\n\n - Can the authors clarify what assumption is being made over the covariates in the dataset $D_{\\geq}$ in Definition 3.1?\n- In Section 4, it mentions that data was collected via two different methodologies. In the end, was data from only the second used to present the results in the end or was it a mix?\n- Can the authors provide more details about how the actual segments that were presented to the labelers were generated? In the appendix it just says that certain trajectories were favored, but it\u2019s unclear to me what that means. Were these generated by demonstrations or an algorithm? Were they generated specifically to have good coverage over the state space?\n See above discussion."

Notable, they argue that the existing approach using the partial returns in the literature is flawed due to the lack of an identifiability property: the ability to recover the reward function underlying the preference dataset. As a result, the importance of using the segment's regret in learning the reward function from preference datasets is highlighted.\n The main contribution of the paper is to introduce a new preference model based on the advantage function. The derivation of the segment's regret as the advantage function is sound and reasonable.\n\nHowever, there are several weaknesses in the paper.\n\n1, if I am not mistaken, the proposed regret model is limited to the case of deterministic policies. How is it extended to stochastic policies?\n\n2, compared with existing approaches that use partial returns, computing the advantage function in the segment's regret is computationally expensive (as mentioned in Appendix A1). While the paper shows an approximation to reduce the computation in Section 6.1, it only works for the linear reward function. Hence, a more detailed discussion on the time complexity of the proposed regret vs. that of the partial returns is necessary, and the work needs to illustrate whether the proposed method is scalable to more practical problems, e.g., by including experiments with neural networks and larger state/action spaces.\n\n3, if I am not missing anything, Theorem 3.1 and 3.2 are not comparable. While both partial returns and the segment's regret use the logistic function (Equation 2 and Equation 5), there is a difference in the two theorems: in Theorem 3.1, if $regret(\\sigma1|\\tilde{r}) < regret(\\sigma_2|\\tilde{r})$, $P_{regret}(\\sigma_1 > \\sigma_2|\\tilde{r}) > 0.5$, in Theorem 3.2, if $\\Sigma_{\\sigma_1} \\tilde{r} > \\Sigma_{\\sigma_2} \\tilde{r}$, $P_{\\Sigma_r}(\\sigma_1 > \\sigma_2|\\tilde{r}) = 1$.\nWhich existing works assume/imply the latter assumption?\nFurthermore, it raises the question of whether $P_{\\Sigma_r}$ is indeed nonidentifiable if Theorem 3.2 has the same premise as Theorem 3.1.\n\n4, there is no comparison with IRL methods (which often rely on the value function or the Q function instead of partial returns): intuitively how they are different, and empirically how they are different (e.g., by experimental results).\n\n5, existing works (e.g., [9,10]), the reward function is define as a function of the state and the action or the state only (i.e., r(s,a), r(s)). Do these reward formulations affect the result in the paper?\n\n6, there is only a toy grid world experiment (a very small state and action space, and linear reward functions) which is quite limited.\n\n\n Please address the weakenesses mentioned above.

They typically underperform in domain adaptation settings, due to geometry shifts caused by different physical environments or LiDAR sensor configurations. Therefore, it is challenging but valuable to learn transferable features between a labeled source domain and a novel target domain, without any access to target labels. To tackle this problem, we introduce the framework of 3D Contrastive Co-training (3D-CoCo) with two technical contributions. First, 3D-CoCo is inspired by our observation that the bird-eye-view (BEV) features are more transferable than low-level geometry features. We thus propose a new co-training architecture that includes separate 3D encoders with domain-specific parameters, as well as a BEV transformation module for learning domain-invariant features. Second, 3D-CoCo extends the approach of contrastive instance alignment to point cloud detection, whose performance was largely hindered by the mismatch between the fictitious distribution of BEV features, induced by pseudo-labels, and the true distribution. The mismatch is greatly reduced by 3D-CoCo with transformed point clouds, which are carefully designed by considering specific geometry priors. We construct new domain adaptation benchmarks using three large-scale 3D datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed 3D-CoCo effectively closes the domain gap and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by large margins. \n"

                "content": " We thank the reviewer for the constructive comments.\n\nQ1. Description of BEV.\n\nBEV is short for Bird's Eye View. The BEV feature is widely used as a form of representation in 3D detection [14,32,33,34,43], especially for autonomous driving. It represents the scene from a view of a high angle that has the potential to avoid scale ambiguity and occlusions of the objects.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nQ2. (1) 3D features vs. BEV features; (2) Spherical convolutions.\n\n(1) It is a common practice in existing 3D detection methods [14,32,34,43] to convert 3D LiDAR points to BEV features, which have the following properties: \n\n- High efficiency: The use of BEV features greatly accelerates the training process, especially compared with point-based methods that generate proposals from each LiDAR point. In practice, we find that training a detection model based on 3D features is very time-consuming and not affordable for large-scale datasets such as nuScenes [1] and Waymo [26].\n\n- Negligible information loss in cross-domain scenarios: In Fig. 1, the 3D domain shift tackled by this paper is mainly caused by different sensor configurations or environments, instead of the intrinsic geometry of objects. Although the transformation of 3D features into 2D space inevitably leads to the information loss in the height dimension, in real auto-driving scenarios, such a loss would not enlarge the domain shift. It is negligible as the domain shift does not mainly exist in the height dimension of the object geometry, which can be learned and inferred from BEV features. \n\n- Single-domain discriminability: The BEV features can offer more compact and global representations of the scene, making it easier for the model to deal with object occlusion. Therefore, it does not reduce the discriminability of the features, nor single-domain performance.\n\n(2) As a classic technique for learning 3D features, the spherical convolution is based on a spherical kernel that updates the features of each point through a graph network. Although it is effective for learning 3D geometry, we find it too computation-intensive to process datasets used in this paper that have larger amounts of LiDAR points.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nQ3. The idea of separate encoders.\n\nSome existing methods for image domain adaptation also use separate encoders to learn domain-specific features [b,c,d], which will be included as related work in the revision. However, to the best of our knowledge, 3D-CoCo is the first one to use such an architecture in 3D scenarios. Different from the previous literature in this field [35], here, the use of separate encoders is motivated by our key observation that  3D transfer learning is hampered by the lack of transferability in low-level 3D features. Further, the separate 3D encoders serve as the base of the entire co-training framework. From an empirical view, they enable 3D-CoCo to improve both in-domain discriminability and cross-domain transferability of the features.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nQ4. In-domain and cross-domain performance.\n\nIn Section 4.3, after the co-training phase, we evaluate the model, which has separate encoders and a domain-agnostic BEV transformation module, respectively on the source domain test set (in-domain) and the target domain test set (cross-domain). \n\nIn Table 2, we show that the co-training improves the performance on both test sets, which may be counter-intuitive as most domain adaptation methods compromise between the in-domain discriminability and cross-domain transferability of the learned features.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nQ5. (1) Definition of co-training; (2) Co-training vs. self-training.\n\n(1) Co-training refers to the entire training strategy in Alg. 1 that jointly uses labeled source data and unlabeled target data during the training phase. This is done by matching similar source and target samples and closing their feature distance through the contrastive loss. \n\n(2) Please refer to our response to Reviewer qi8q (Q2). \n\n&nbsp;\n\nQ6. (1) Bi-directional knowledge sharing; (2) Random object scaling (ROS).\n\n(1) Empirically, bi-directional knowledge sharing (Line 112) means that the co-training improves the performance on both source and target test sets. Based on the separate encoders, this is mainly realized by performing contrastive alignment between source and target data, and optimizing the model with data input from different domains under a unified contrast loss term. Thus, the so-called bi-directional knowledge sharing is different from typical multi-task learning methods.\n\n(2) From SN [28], the different object size is an essential part of domain shift. To this end, we use the ROS from ST3D [35] as an alternative technique upon 3D-CoCo, which leads to a tradeoff between in-domain and cross-domain performance. In Table 2, for a comprehensive comparison, we use two different ranges of the ROS factor, one for better adaptation results, while the other for better source performance. We observe that in both settings, 3D-CoCo outperforms the Source Only baseline remarkably on the target test set.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nQ7. (1) The warm-up stage; (2) Notation of augmented target set.\n\n(1) In Fig. 4 (a1), the performance fluctuates in the first 15 epochs and then converges stably before updating the pseudo-labels. Thus, warming-up the model is necessary. It can improve the efficacy of the first pseudo-labels update stage by avoiding a very ill-defined detection model. An empirical parameter for ending the warm-up stage is at half of the total epochs.\n\n(2) Thanks for the suggestion. We'll fix it in the revision.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nQ8. Expanding $L_\\text{cls}^S$, $L_\\text{loc}^S$, and $L_\\text{reg}^T$.\n\n**Please use Safari or Firefox to display the equations in LaTeX properly.**\n\nWe use CenterPoint [38] as the base detector to predict Gaussian heatmaps at each annotated object center $q_i$ for each class $c_i\\in \\{1\\cdot\\cdot\\cdot |C|\\}$, where $i$ is the object index. For pixel position $p$ in the heatmap of category $k$, we have $Y_{p,k} = \\max_{i:c_i=k}\\exp(-\\frac{{(p-q_i)}^2}{2\\sigma_i^2})$, where $\\sigma_i$ is the size of the object, and $\\max_{i:c_i=k}$ covers all objects under category $k$. We define $L_\\text{cls}^S$ in a form of focal loss:\n\n$$L_\\text{cls}^S =  -\\frac{1}{N^S}\\sum_{p,k} (1-\\hat Y_{p,k}^S)^{\\alpha} \\log(\\hat Y_{p,k}^S) , \\text{if~} Y_{p,k}^S = 1,$$\n\n$$L_\\text{cls}^S = -\\frac{1}{N^S} \\sum_{p,k} (1-Y_{p,k}^S)^{\\beta}(\\hat Y_{p,k}^S)^{\\alpha}\\log(1-\\hat Y_{p,k}^S), \\text{otherwise},$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha=2$, $\\beta=4$, and $N^S$ is the number of objects. \n\nThe other two loss terms regress the size map $Z$, center offset map $O$, and rotation map $A$:\n\n$$L_\\text{loc}^S = \\frac{1}{N^S}\\sum_{i=1}^{N^S}\\lambda_X|\\widehat{X}_{q_i}^S -X_i^S|, X = \\{Z,O,A\\}.$$\n\n$$L_\\text{reg}^T = \\frac{1}{N^T}\\sum_{i=1}^{N^T}\\lambda_X|\\widehat{X}_{q_i}^T -X_i^T|, X = \\{Z,O,A\\}.$$\n\n&nbsp;\n\nQ9.

(1) HSM on source domain; (2) HSM vs. the consistency regularization [f,g].\n\n(1) We agree that augmenting the source domain is an effective way to improve generalization ability. However, the proposed HSM specifically focuses on reducing the distribution mismatch caused by the limited diversity of target pseudo-labels. HSM can be combined with any other augmentation methods performed on the source domain.\n\n(2) The consistency regularization introduces data perturbations and forces the model output to remain unchanged. These methods use common augmentation strategies (e.g., flipping and cropping). By contrast, our method creates fictitious hard samples by considering the priors of geometry variations. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nQ14.

(4)?\n\n(1) We follow the pseudo-label generation process of ST3D [35], which has two parts. First, before the warm-up training stage, we use the source detection model to initialize the pseudo-labels. Second, after the warm-up stage, we progressively refine the pseudo-labels at each training epoch, which specifically has two steps:\n\n- Matching and merging the currently updated pseudo-labels with the previous ones (termed Memory Ensemble by ST3D): This is done by calculating a 3D IoU matrix of the object detection boxes under two adjacent updates of pseudo-labels, and treating pairs that exceed a certain threshold as matching pairs. We then take the boxes with higher confidence as the current pseudo-labels.\n\n- Marking the status of the unmatched pseudo boxes of the first step to determine whether to discard them (termed Memory Voting by ST3D): When a new unmatched box appears, we assume that it is a correct sample caused by the model update, and we thus save the box and record its the number of its unsuccessful matches. If the box is unmatched for a long time after several epochs, it is considered to be an incorrect sample and will be permanently deleted.\n\n(2) Given a source sample $I_i^S$, Eq. (4) searches for its positive target sample $I_{j^\\star}^T$ to optimize the contrastive loss in Eq. (5). Concretely, we calculate the cosine distances, denoted by $\\Phi(\\cdot, \\cdot)$, between $I_i^S$ and all target samples under the same category $c$ (indicated by the same pseudo-labels), among which we select the one with the smallest distance as $I_{j^\\star}^T$, where $j^\\star = \\mathop{\\arg\\min}\\limits_{1\\leq j\\leq N_c^T}\\{\\Phi(I_i^S, I_j^T)\\}$. Please use the Safari or Firefox browser to display the equations in LaTeX properly.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nQ2. (1) How to process or avoid the possible errors of pseudo-labels? (2) Analyses of the relationship between the quality of pseudo-labels and the final performance.\n\n(1) In our domain adaptation scenarios, the errors of pseudo-labels are mainly caused by the distribution shift across domains. In 3D-CoCo, they are processed in three ways:\n\n- The progressive updates of pseudo-labels are helpful to improve the quality of pseudo-labels and eliminate the existing errors (as explained in the above response).\n\n- The proposed co-training framework uses the source labeled data as strong guidance, which has great effects on the feature learning process of the target data. Therefore, the quality of pseudo-labels is gradually improved during the training phase. \n\n- The proposed method of hard sample mining is helpful to enrich the pseudo-labels and can further avoid errors of pseudo-labels caused by the distribution shift across domains. \n\n(2) The visualization in Fig. 4 shows that the three contributions mentioned above are indeed helpful to avoid the errors of pseudo-labels, and the final performance is largely dependent on the quality of pseudo-labels. More specifically,\n\n- We use the ratio of true positive and false positive predictions (#TPs/#FPs) to indicate the quality of pseudo-labels. By comparing the final performance in Fig. 4 (a1) and (b1), as well as the corresponding quality of pseudo-labels in (a2) and (b2), we can see that high-quality pseudo-labels lead to better detection results. \n\n- The progressive refinement of pseudo-labels is helpful to improve the label quality and the detection results. The strong evidence is that at around the 15th training epoch in Fig. 4 (b2) after the warm-up stage, the green curve (i.e., co-training with label update) and the blue curve (i.e., co-training with label update and hard sample mining) grow rapidly, and the model performance in (b1) grows simultaneously. During these periods, the pseudo-labels are progressively refined with hard sample mining in each training epoch. Please refer to our response to Reviewer DPJL for more analyses.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nQ3. Simulation to real. \n\nWe agree that the simulation-to-real is an interesting transfer learning setup. However, due to time constraints, we plan to conduct such experiments in future work and hope to provide results in the revision."

(5), we correct the typos in the manuscript and re-write the three loss terms as:\n\n$\\mathcal L_\\text{intra-class}(S,T) = \\sum_{c=1}^{|C|}\\sum_{i\\in N_c^S}\\log\\frac{\\exp(I^S_i\\cdot I^T_{j^\\star}/\\tau)}{\\exp(I_i^S\\cdot I_{j^\\star}/\\tau) + \\sum_{j\\in N_{\\tilde{c}}^T} \\exp(I_i^S\\cdot I_j^T)},$\n\n$\\mathcal L_\\text{inter-class}(S) = \\sum_{c=1}^{|C|}\\sum_{i\\in N_c^S, j\\in N_c^S, i\\neq j}\\log\\frac{\\exp(I^S_i\\cdot I^S_j/\\tau)}{\\exp(I_i^S\\cdot I_j^S/\\tau) + \\sum_{j\\in N_{\\tilde{c}}^{S}} \\exp(I_i^S\\cdot I_j^S)},$\n\n$\\mathcal L_\\text{inter-class}(T) = \\sum_{c=1}^{|C|}\\sum_{i\\in N_c^T, j\\in N_c^T, i\\neq j}\\log\\frac{\\exp(I^T_i\\cdot I^T_j/\\tau)}{\\exp(I_i^T\\cdot I_j^T/\\tau) + \\sum_{j\\in N_{\\tilde{c}}^{T}} \\exp(I_i^T\\cdot I_j^T)}.$\n\nThe loss terms have two parts:\n\n- $\\mathcal L_\\text{intra-class}(S,T)$ encourages to close the intra-class distances of samples in the same category cross domains.

Like $\\mathcal L_\\text{intra-class}(S,T)$, samples in the positive pairs are from the same category and those in the negative pairs are from different categories.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nQ2. Co-training vs. self-training.\n\nIn addition to the comparisons in Lines 294-298 in the manuscript, here we summarize the differences between co-training and self-training planned to be included in the revision.\n\nSelf-training (typically for single-domain semi-supervised learning):\n\n- A teacher model is trained on the labeled data. \n\n- The teacher model generates pseudo-labels on unlabeled data.\n\n- A student model is trained to optimize the loss on human labels and pseudo-labels jointly. \n\nCo-training (for cross-domain transfer learning, also shown in Alg. 1):\n\n- A source model is trained on the labeled data of the source domain. \n\n- A target model initialized with the source model generates (updates) pseudo-labels for unlabeled data of the target domain.\n\n- The pseudo-labels are then used to mine the hard samples to augment the target domain.\n\n- The target model and the source model are co-trained with the detection loss (for source data), a regularization term (for target data), as well as the contrastive loss (for both). \n\n- Go back to the second step and then iterate.\n\nThe most essential difference between the two strategies is whether the source (teacher) model and the target (student) model are jointly learned. The contrastive loss transfers knowledge from the source domain by narrowing the distance between the sample features of different domains under the same category (indicated by pseudo-labels), thus facilitating the learning process on the unlabeled target set. As illustrated by the empirical results in Fig. 4 and the analyses of error bars in the supplementary material, in contrast with self-training, the proposed co-training strategy not only improves the accuracy but also performs more stably."

                "title": "Our Response to Reviewer DPJL",
                "content": " We thank the reviewer for the constructive comments.\n\nQ1. To combine the proposed approach with PV-RCNN for a fair comparison with ST3D.  \n\nPer the reviewer's request, we build the proposed 3D-CoCo on PV-RCNN (i.e., 3D-CoCo*) to make a fair comparison with ST3D [35]. Due to the time constraint of the rebuttal period, we partly build our method without using the hard sample mining scheme. The experimental result on the nuScenes $\\rightarrow$ KITTI benchmark is represented as follows: \n\n| Method | $\\text{AP}_\\text{BEV}$ (%) | $\\text{AP}_\\text{3D}$ (%)\n| :-----| ----: | :----:\n| Source Only | 60.48 | 49.47 \n| ST3D [35] | 84.29 | 72.94\n| 3D-CoCo* | 85.01 | 74.12 \n| Oracle | 88.98 | 82.50\n\nFrom above, 3D-CoCo is superior to ST3D on the new base detector of PV-RCNN. It is worth noting that the proposed method of hard sample mining has the potential to further improve the adaptation performance. We'll implement the full 3D-CoCo approach based on PV-RCNN in the revision.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nQ2. (1) Sensitivity analyses of 3D-CoCo to the pseudo-label generation thresholds; (2) how to determine the thresholds?\n\n(1) Fig. 4 (c2) provides the sensitivity analyses of the high-pass threshold for generating pseudo-labels (i.e., the confidence score ranging from 0.5 to 0.8). By comparing the results with those of self-training, as shown in Fig. 4 (c1), we can see that: \n\n- 3D-CoCo is robust to different threshold values. It outperforms the Source Only baseline consistently, with all possible values, and significantly, with 50%-100% final performance gains in $\\text{AP}_\\text{3D}$. In contrast, self-training fails to improve the Source Only baseline with some threshold values.\n\n- At different thresholds, the performance of 3D-CoCo is stably increased throughout the training procedure, while the training process of self-training is quite unstable.\n\n(2) We adopt the value of the low-pass threshold (0.2) from the existing work of ST3D [35], because the empirical evidence given by ST3D shows that the sensitivity of the detection model to the low-pass threshold is lower than the high-pass threshold. \n\nBesides, we follow the hyper-parameter tuning strategy of ST3D and set the high-pass threshold to 0.7 on all benchmarks. We observe that:\n\n- In practice, as mentioned above, our method is more robust to different values of the high-pass threshold than the self-training framework of ST3D.\n\n- We only determined the high-pass threshold on the first benchmark, and found it robust on other benchmarks, in the sense that no further tuning on these hyper-parameters is required.\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nQ3. Analyses and visualizations about pseudo-label adjustment during the training phase to illustrate why and how the proposed method could achieve good results with low-quality initialized pseudo-labels.\n\nThe visualization in Fig. 4 shows that, in 3D-CoCo, the progressive update of pseudo-labels is closely related to the final results, and the key to achieving good results with low-quality initialized pseudo-labels lies in three aspects:\n\n(1) In Fig. 4 (b2), we use the ratio of true positive and false positive predictions to indicate the quality of pseudo-labels.\n\n- At the beginning of the training phase, we have low-quality initialized pseudo-labels due to the large distribution shift across domains. \n\n- At around the 15th training epoch after the warm-up stage (w.r.t. Line 5, Alg. 1), #TPs/#FPs of the blue and green curves grow rapidly, and the model performance in Fig. 4 (b1) grows simultaneously. During these periods, we adjust pseudo-labels in each training epoch (Line 7, Alg. 1).\n\nAnalyses: In 3D-CoCo, the iterative training scheme of (i) pseudo-label adjustment and (ii) model optimization gradually improves the quality of pseudo-labels, which has great effects on the domain adaptation performance.\n\n(2) In Fig. 4 (a2), we validate the effectiveness of the contrastive loss by only using the low-quality initialized pseudo-labels throughout the training phase, without pseudo-label adjustment. We can see that, compared with the self-training method, #TPs/#FPs of 3D-CoCo increases more rapidly during the training phase, and the model performance in Fig. 4 (a1) also grows remarkably. \n\nAnalyses: The contrastive loss contributes to adapting the feature distribution of the target domain to the source domain. Even without high-quality pseudo-labels of the target data, it improves the detection results of target samples under the guidance of source labeled data. \n\n(3) Also shown in Fig. 4 (b1-b2), the proposed method of hard sample mining (HSM) further promotes the pseudo-label adjustment in the training phase, thus improving the domain adaptation performance.\n"

                "content": "This work presents an unsupervised domain adaptation for point cloud detection in the autonomous driving scenario, which employs a domain-specific 3D encoder for domain-specific feature extraction, a shared BEV feature transformation module for domain-invariant instance-level feature alignment. It adapts the contrastive instance alignment with geometry priors to align the BEV feature distributions induced by pseudo-labels and the true distribution. The proposed 3D-CoCo works on three transferring settings, effectively closing the domain gaps and can outperform recent SOTA methods.  This study is useful for researchers in both fields of unsupervised domain transfer and point cloud detection in the autonomous driving scenario. The proposed 3D-CoCo tries to utilize the domain knowledge induced by this special task to produce an effective unsupervised domain adaptation, rather than simply adopts the tricks used in 2D unsupervised domain adaptation. To be specific, it is nice to see that 3D-CoCo would like to specifically handle the domain drift caused by geometric variations, and designs a hard negative mining strategy by examining the statistics of pseudo-label quality. The experiments show good results on three datasets collected by heterogeneous LiDAR sensors, and outperform recent UDA methods on point cloud detection. \n\nBut the presentation needs to be polished. At first, symbols and terms in equations (4) and (5) may require a careful definition and remove some careless misuses. And the functionalities of the introduced terms and symbols should be briefly discussed. The authors claimed the effectiveness of co-training beyond self-training, but how they are especially different, or in what aspects co-training is better should be explicitly stated.\n\nOverall, this paper is well written, clearly illustrated, and appropriately structured.  It has included the limitations. The potential negative societal impact of their work  may not be available."

                "content": "This paper contributes as an early study of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) on 3D point cloud detection, an important step towards zero cost of labeling. Different from 2D image data that have regular grid structures, 3D point cloud data could have huge geometric variations such as point density and occlusion due to different physical environments or LiDAR sensor configurations; consequently, the low-level features of point cloud representation may be not transferable across domains. Taking it into account, this paper uses two individual encoders for the source and target domains to capture domain-specific characteristics and a shared Bird-Eye-View (BEV) transformation module to learn domain-agnostic BEV features, which have similar grid structures as images and thus are more transferable. Specifically, this paper extends contrastive instance alignment to point cloud detection, based on BEW features of foreground and background proposals. Direct use of contrastive instance alignment can cause the mismatch in point density and occlusion ratio between pseudo-labeled and true samples distributions in the target domain. To address it, this paper proposes to augment positive easy target samples (with dense points and complete geometry) by their artificial counterparts with sparse points and occlusion. Moreover, this paper constructs a new benchmark using three large-scale datasets. Empirical results show that the proposed method is effective and achieves the new state of the art.  Although the contributions and novelty of this paper are considerable, there are still many problems.\n\n1. The full name should be mentioned when BEV is shown for the first time in Section 1, where it would be better to provide a brief description of BEV and its related references for a wider range of audiences.\n\n2. It would be better to compare the high-level 3D features with the BEV features. The high-level 3D features are extracted by the same but deeper network layers than the low-level ones. The 3D domain shift is mapped into the 2D one, causing information loss.  Would it reduce the feature discriminability? Would it affect the single-domain detection performance, e.g., cases of a general detection setup in individual domains? It is also interesting to know how the features extracted by spherical convolutions [a] behave.\n\n3. The idea of separate encoders is similar to that of [b,c,d] for 2D UDA. The authors should consider them as related works and make comparisons and discussions appropriately. \n\n4.  It is interesting to approximately quantify the distribution discrepancy across domains based on the performances of passing source samples through the target encoder and passing target samples through the source encoder. In Section 4.3, the in-domain performance is evaluated on the target domain; however, according to the previous descriptions, the cross-domain performance should be evaluated on the target domain. There exists a contradiction and a clarification is required.\n\n5. Does the \"co-training\" in this paper mean two individual encoders for the source and target domains? Or the training strategy? This paper also adopts the pseudo-labeling technique from self-training. In Lines 56-59, the difference is not clear enough. \n\n6. In Lines 109-112, \"bi-directional knowledge sharing\" is similar to multi-task learning [e]? Why does it hold? Are there any related works that support this argument? In the ablation studies, it seems that the random object scaling has a great effect on the source performance and this has nothing to do with the proposed method. \n\n7. In Algorithm 1, this paper conducts three-stage training. why not two stages? The warm-up stage introduces another set of training hyperparameters. Besides, the augmented target set is denoted by the original one? The notations should be different.\n\n8. It would be more clear to expand the losses of L_cls^S, L_loc^S, and L_reg^T.\n\n9. In Section 3.2, this paper uses a keypoint-based feature extraction approach. Comparisons with other kinds of feature extraction approaches are needed. Besides, the model sensitivity to the hyperparameter R is to be examined.\n\n10. In Eq. (5), some notations are confusing, such as the summation range in the denominator in L_intra and L_inter. A negative sign is missing in L_intra and L_inter? Otherwise, samples of the same classes are pushed away? In L_intra, samples of other classes should be used as negative ones whereas this paper does not make it clear. In L_inter, other samples in the same class are used as negative ones? Is this the typical contrastive learning method of instance discrimination from self-supervised learning? How can this method increase the inter-class distance between different categories within the same domain? Are there any references for contrastive instance alignment? The main component of the proposed algorithm is so ambiguous that the experimental results may be not so convincing. \n\n11. In Eq. (5), the domain \\mathcal{D} is similar to model D; it would be better to use different notations. In Eq. (6), \"arg\" is redundant. The model sensitivity to the temperature \\tao and the hyperparameter \\lambda is to be examined. \n\n12. In Line 159, is there a specific rule to distinguish between easy and hard samples? Please make it clear. In Line 166, how many points are discarded? In Line 169, how to calculate the viewpoint of a certain sample? How many viewpoints do you select to discard? Are there any solid principles to make decisions? Are there any related references? Please make it clear. \n\n13. In Lines 170-173, the proposed augmentation can also be done in the source domain since source samples can be viewed as easy ones. Consequently, the distribution mismatch between the source and target domains can be further reduced. It is interesting to see whether the model performance can be further improved. The proposed augmentation strategy is somewhat similar to consistency regularization [f,g] from semi-supervised learning, which enforces consistent predictions between weakly and strongly augmented versions of the same sample image. Maybe the related works should be considered and discussed.\n\n14. In Line 179, can you describe how to update the pseudo labels in detail? \n\n15. Is each domain split into training and test sets? Is the performance evaluated on the training or test set of the target domain?\n\n\n[a] H. Lei, N. Akhtar and A.

Annotating point clouds is more difficult and expensive than annotating images for object detection tasks. Good 3D UDA methods are desired to reduce the annotation efforts. On the constructed new benchmark of three autonomous driving datasets, this paper achieves a significant gain in detection performance, one step closer to the goal. As for the limitation, this paper has mentioned that the proposed method takes more memory footprint than existing self-training methods at the training time whereas does not address it. The potential negative societal impact of their work has not been mentioned. The suggestions for improvement are provided in Main Review."
